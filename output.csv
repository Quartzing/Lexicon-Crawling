10-k filing,"10-k filing. The Securities and Exchange Commission in the US requires publicly traded companies to disclose annual accounts on form 10-k. Quarterly reports are filed on on form 10-q and reports detailing specified company news on 8-k. The SEC explains that form 10-k should provide a comprehensive review of the company's business and financial condition and include audited financial statements. The annual report on form 10-k is a different requirement from the annual report to shareholders that a company must prepare before its annual meeting to elect directors. The SEC imposes deadlines for filing of all its reports. Its reports are viewable through a public database.   10-k filing in the news In June 2012, pressure groups interested in sustainable investment called for companies who fill in Form 10-k, which includes mandatory disclosure of risk factors, to include ethical, social and governance factors. The disclosure of risks also featured in an FT column outlining the risks associated with rising student loan debt in the United States. ITT Educational Services (ITT-ESI) wrote in its 10-k filing ""We are not able to estimate the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the RSAs [risk-sharing agreements that the company managed to make with others such as the Deutsche Bank Credit Solutions Group in London]."" 10-k filings were also helping investors at the beginning of March 2013 when Chesapeake Energy revealed on its form 10-k that the SEC had started a formal enquiry over its controversial remuneration plan."

130/30,"A 130/30 investment strategy is one that invests both long and short at the same time in an attempt to outperform a given index. It is called a 130/30 fund because the manager shorts up to 30 per cent of the assets in the fund (he borrows shares that he thinks are most likely to fall in price and sells them in the open market and buying them back at a later date after their price has fallen, locking in profits). The earnings from the short selling can be reinvested, allowing the fund manager to have 130% of the portfolio in long positions. The 130/30 ratio is a widely-used term for this type of strategy, but other ratios are possible.  130/30 funds in the news In May 2013 an FT writer investigated the decline in interest in 130/30 funds, mainly because they had underperformed compared to expectations. Some blamed the poor performance on some managers' inability to master the skills required for shorting."
1967 borders,"The term  1967 borders  refers to the armistice lines that existed between Israel and its Arab neighbours prior to the 1967 Six-Day war. They separated Israel from the Gaza Strip, at the time held by Egypt; from the West Bank and East Jerusalem, under Jordanian control; and from the Golan Heights, which were part of Syria. All these areas were conquered by Israel in the war, and later partly annexed. Palestinians want to establish their state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as the capital. Israel, however, wants to keep parts of the occupied territories, especially those areas that are today home to Jewish settlements. [1]"
3 Fs,"The three Fs are friends, family and fools - the people to talk to first when pitching an idea.  Less than 1 per cent of start-ups raise venture capital so the 3Fs are important. Relying on friends who are willing to invest in you and family that feel obligated to invest in you is a great way to get started. This is why entrepreneurs spend a lot of time cultivating their social network   you never know who might be a potential funder for your idea. This is also why I often advise my students that working for a large company initially might be the ideal way to end up as an entrepreneur later on. At large companies, employees can gain valuable knowledge about the market and make new friends who can play a significant role in future ventures, whether as a colleague, funder or acquirer. Despite the typical image of an entrepreneurial venture springing from 'two guys in a garage', most entrepreneurs have significant industry experience. [1]"
30% Club,"The 30% Club, or 30 Percent Club, is a group of chairmen of boards who are voluntarily committed to bringing more women onto UK corporate boards. In January 2013 the group said that on average FTSE 100 companies have only 17.3 per cent female representation on boards.  The group lobbies to bring that percentage to 30 per cent arguing that having a better balance   at least 30 per cent of senior female leaders   positively influences a company's culture and decision making processes. However, it opposes proposals to introduce mandatory quotas for women representation on boards, preferring to leave 30 per cent as a target.   30% Club in the news In January 2013 the UK House of Lords held a debate on boardroom diversity, which deplored low levels of female board representation, but rejected EU quotas. In November 2012, the European Union had announced that European companies will be forced to hire a female candidate over an equally qualified male   or face sanctions   unless women occupy at least 40 per cent of their board seats by 2020. EU data showed that women fill only 13.7 per cent of board positions in large listed companies. There is a lot of variation across different European countries. At the latest count in Europe, women accounted for 27 per cent of the board members of large listed companies in Finland, 26 per cent in Latvia and 25 per cent in Sweden, but only 5 per cent in Hungary, 4 per cent in Cyprus and 3 per cent in Malta.

401k,"In the US, 401k refers to a type of pension plan where a company pays an amount of money into the plan that matches the amount that an employee pays into it, with tax advantages for both. They are called 401k because that refers to the clause in tax law which governs them. Under current tax laws employees are not taxed on the money invested in their 401k. The money is only taxed once the pension saver draws down funds. In 401k plan employees can choose from a a range of funds available from the provider."
403b plan,"Named after a section of the US tax code, 403b plans are offered by employers to allow employees to save for retirement on a pre-tax basis. Unlike 401k plans, 403b plans are only available to employees of certain tax-exempt organisations, public schools and civil governments. [1]"
529 plans,"Named after a section of the US federal tax code created in 1996, 529 college savings plans are designed to allow families and individuals to save for future college costs in a tax advantaged way. Sponsored by individual states, 529 college savings plans allow individuals to designate a  beneficiary  that can use the money in the account to pay for eligible college expenses. Once money is placed in a 529 plan account, it is invested in stock mutual funds, bond funds, money market funds or other types of funds. [1]"

"A, B, C share","A, B, and C shares are different classes of a company's shares. Each class has different characteristics, for example on rights to vote at shareholders' meetings. Typically different classes of stock are created if the original owner of a company wishes to raise a large amount of capital but retain majority voting rights. There is no standard naming procedure. The shares with the enhanced voting rights could be called either A or B, for example. This means investors need to read the company's prospectus to check."
A-share,"A-shares are shares of Chinese companies listed on either the Shanghai or Shenzhen stock exchanges. They are denominated in renminbi and were originally only available to domestic investors. In 2002 foreign entities were able to gain a small amount of access via quotas issued to qualified foreign institutional investors (QFII). The term A-share is also used to refer to a share class. Companies might issue shares with different voting rights, for example. See A/B/C share.   A-shares in the news In November 2012 an FT writer compared the fortunes of the A-shares on the Shanghai stock exchange with the H-shares listed in Hong Kong. The Shanghai Composite was reported to be two thirds down from its peak while Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong, known as H-shares or red chips had risen 15 per cent since the end of August. In March 2013, a commentator thought the widening of the QFII scheme bringing in more foreign participants might help rationalise the A-share market."
A-share/B-share markets,"Mainland China's two stock exchanges, in Shanghai and Shenzhen, both have A- and B-share markets. The key distinction is that A-shares are denominated in renminbi and B-shares in foreign currency (US dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong dollars in Shenzhen). For a long time, the other main difference between the two, from a regulatory standpoint, was that the A-share market was closed to foreign investors while the B-share market was open only to foreigners. However in 2001, the Chinese authorities tried to boost the B-share market by opening it to individual Chinese investors. And in 2003, a scheme was introduced whereby select foreign institutions were allowed to buy A-shares. Some companies have their stocks listed on both boards, but their B-shares trade at a large discount to their A-shares, which tend to see much larger trading volumes."

AER,"Annual equivalent rate; a rate of interest which shows how much interest you receive from an investment in one year if each interest payment is added to the deposit before the following year's payment is calculated. [1] AER - or the annual equivalent rate - not only takes into account the interest rate of a savings account, for example, but how often that interest is paid. Normally bank and building society accounts pay interest annually and, when this happens, the AER will be the same as the gross (before-tax) rate of interest. If, however, the same interest rate is paid more frequently, such as monthly, the AER will be higher. AER shows the true cost of a finance deal when either money is being borrowed or saved. ExampleA savings account providing an interest rate of 4.65 per cent paid monthly actually has an AER of 4.75 per cent not 4.65 per cent. If the interest in paid annually the AER will also be 4.65 per cent. So if, for example, you are trying to find the best savings account make sure you compare like with like, i.e. a gross savings rate with another gross savings rate or an AER with another AER. [2]"

AIFMD,"AIFMD stands for the Alternative Investment Fund Managers' Directive. The AIFMD is one of a package of measures drawn up by the European Commission after the 2008/9 financial crisis to regulate financial services. It aims to establish a harmonised regulatory framework for monitoring and supervising the perceived risks posed by unregulated alternative investment funds such as private equity and hedge funds. Rather than regulate the funds themselves, however, the directive targets their fund managers. The AIFMD includes requirements for authorisation, or at the very least registration, of the fund manager, conduct of business (including fair treatment of investors, conflicts of interest and disclosure requirements), regulatory capital, safekeeping of investments, marketing and leverage. The AIFMD was published in July 2011 and was set to be implemented by in July 2013. In July 2014 a transitional period would end after which all relevant managers would have to be able to prove compliance.    AIFMD in the news In August 2013, soon after implementation of the AIFMD directive, an FT Alphaville post drew attention to a stumbling block. Jonathan Faull, the director general of internal market and services at the European Commission wrote to Esma (the European Securities and Markets Authority) on confusion over the definitions of open and closed ended funds which would have different regulatory requirements. In September 2013 the UK's Financial Conduct Authority was reported to have published guidelines on how it planned to implement the AIFMD. It said that fund managers handling between  500m and  1.5bn if assets might be allowed to opt out of pay restrictions that would force managers to receive half of their pay in units of their funds and to defer payment over longer time periods."

Abenomics,"Abenomics is the name given to a suite of measures introduced by Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe after his December 2012 re-election to the post he last held in 2007. His aim was to revive the sluggish economy with ""three arrows"": a massive fiscal stimulus, more aggressive monetary easing from the Bank of Japan, and structural reforms to boost Japan's competitiveness. By the end of February the measures had resulted in a dramatic weakening of the yen and a 22 per cent rise in the Topix stock market index since his election win. Japan's central bank had also yielded to pressure from Mr Abe's administration to set an inflation target of 2 per cent.    Abenomics in the news An FT columnist commented that the boost contributed by a cheaper yen might be artificial. Overseas investors might also demand to be compensated for the risk on the currency side. There are concerns that the spending policies could be ill-conceived like previous infrastructural projects undertaken during past governments with stimulative policies. Inflation could also have the added unwanted effect of reducing consumption. In March 2013, an FT writer commented that Abenomics could be catching on with some employers who had awarded wage rises and bonuses. One of the key tenets of prime minister Abe's reforms is the need for wage growth. In June 2013, the so-called ""third arrow"" fired by Shinzo Abe aimed at bringing structural reforms to the economy, left investors disappointed. One FT columnist wrote that the heart had been ripped out of the Abenomics trade as Japanese stocks fell back into a bear market. But it was also reported that Abenomics had helped Japanese regain their appetite for luxury spending. In October 2013, in an interview with the Financial Times, Shinzo Abe defended his ""buy my Abenomics"" speech which he made to the New York Stock Exchange in September 2013. He declared he was on track and ready to pursue his ""third arrow""   a growth strategy to complement the first two arrows of monetary expansion and fiscal flexibility   in more depth.

Anglo-Saxon capitalism,"Despite its name, Anglo-Saxon capitalism has nothing to do with the trade in stone axes.  Instead it is a term often used to describe a form of capitalism that is said to be prevalent in the English speaking world - in particular the US and UK, but also in Canada, Australasia and Ireland. The ""Anglo-Saxon"" variant of capitalism is thought to be characterised, at the level of states, by lower taxes, looser regulation, a weaker social-safety net and greater ease for firms to hire and fire employees - and to take each other over. At the level of individual firms and businesses, Anglo-Saxon capitalism is said to emphasise the interests of shareholders, rather than other stakeholders such as employees. Its critics say that it emphasises short-term profits at the expense of long-term planning. Anglo-Saxon capitalism is sometimes contrasted with the more ""corporatist"" models, traditionally favoured in Germany, France and Japan - which can emphasise long-term relationships with banks, rather than shareholders - and which are more accepting of the idea of a state-led industrial policy. Another variant is ""nordic capitalism"", where firms operate against the background of a high-tax, high-spend government. [1]"

Anonymous,"Anonymous is an amorphous group of hacktivists. Anonymous began as a small group protesting internet censorship, using novel ways designed to grab press attention. As idealists swelled the ranks, though, its unusually open and officially leaderless structure allowed it to be penetrated by cyber criminals and career hackers, who launched direct attacks on law enforcement. This was a long way from the chatter on teen-oriented message boards inside the 4chanwebsite, which was founded in 2003. (The name  Anonymous  comes from the identity given by default to anyone posting comments there.) It was the Church of Scientology, which had a history of using copyright laws to go after critics and suppress internal documents, that was the catalyst for transforming Anonymous from online hangout to activist power. The process took less than a fortnight. In January 2008, 4chan visitors and others passed around a YouTube video of Tom Cruise talking about Scientology. Ignoring the maxim that, on the internet, squashing something makes it bigger, the church served YouTube with a copyright warning and got the video taken down. This offended 4chan regulars such as Gregg Housh, an anti-establishment website programmer. A debate began over what to do. One suggestion was that since YouTube videos are often downloaded and reposted, the group should look out for a repost and grab a copy for distribution to other sites. It did just that, adding text naming another internet chat that viewers could join to plot next steps. More than 50 people signed in. Some suggested an answering video, with a digitised voice reading a press release where  Anonymous  declared  war  on Scientology. As Housh and his online peers put the finishing touches to the press release, someone suggested the ominous tagline:  Expect Us . Housh loved it.  You win   he shouted. With help from the press, Anonymous s attacks on behalf of WikiLeaks brought it to its widest ever audience.[1]. Anonymous became involved with helping disseminate WikiLeaks information from the earliest days in 2006-2008 and  Anonymous rushed to WikiLeaks  aid in December 2010 when the whistleblowing site faced what it has described as an  economic blockade  from payments processing companies. Anonymous  subsequent attacks caused service interruptions to MasterCard, Visa and PayPal websites, and the group remained loyal to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and his site throughout his extradition battle over allegations of sexual assault, and despite a crackdown from police around the world against the hackers. Anonymous was reported to have withdrawn support for WikiLeaks towards the end of 2012 after individuals claiming to be members of the group  said the whistleblowing site had been ruined by egos.   Anonymous in the news In April 2013, Anonymous threatened a cyber attack on Israel. In a video posted on the YouTube website, Anonymous said that Israel had  crossed a line in the sand  by threatening to sever all internet and telecommunications links out of the Gaza Strip."

Asian financial crisis,"The severe economic slowdown and monetary crisis that affected most Asian countries after massive speculative activity forced the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997. Many other currencies came under heavy pressure from speculators, forcing interest rates to rise, while asset values fell as money flowed out of Asia. Banking systems came under enormous pressure, with bad debt levels rising sharply. The exact reasons for the crisis are still being debated - one theory is the contradiction between pegged currencies and fundamental asset values, with poor banking controls leading to excessive exposure to corrective forces. The crisis lasted through 1998, but growth remained weak until the Internet boom began to take hold in 1999-2000. The deflationary impact of the Asian financial crisis could still be felt until economies began a sustained recovery in 2003."

Austrian economics,"School of economic thought originating in Austria in the late nineteenth century which focuses on the concept of opportunity cost. [1] In economic theory, the term Austrian School stands for liberalism and laissez-faire-economics (where economic performance is optimised when there is limited government interference). The Austrian School of economics has its original roots in the work of Carl Menger from the University of Vienna . References to the topic were first published in 1871. Well-known followers of Menger included Eugen von B hm-Bawerk (1851   1914), Ludwig von Mises (1881   1973) and, perhaps most important, Friedrich A. Hayek (1899   1929). Hayek, for example, strongly rejected any intervention by the state in the economy. For him, markets work perfectly in the sense that the market price balances supply and demand.  A perfect market is one characterised by easy access to information, no barriers to entry and with prices controlled by all participants. Due to the global financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, the popularity of the Austrian School of economics has experienced a boost in recent times because it had predicted, a long time ago, that too much debt   due to too low interest rates   would trigger investment bubbles followed by a crisis after these bubbles burst.  For example, look at Ireland s property bubble, which was fuelled by reckless lending by banks to property developers. ExampleIn contrast to Keynesianism, the Austrian School of thought holds that the business cycle is driven by the supply side of the economy, not demand. If interest rates are too low, we will have over-investment. This may lead to over-production, which may trigger a crisis. During the crisis, supply declines until it is once again equal to overall demand. Then a new cycle starts. For the Austrian school, the main challenge is not inflation, but over-investment in the face of too much money, or too-low interest rates that can lead to a crisis.  Too much money means that the growth of money supply is much higher than the growth of goods and services in an economy. This leads to inflation, which is an increase in the average prices of all goods because there is more money available. This means that the right level of the interest rate, called the  natural rate of interest , is crucial to prevent a crisis. This type of interest rate attracts enough investment to ensure full employment and no inflation. If the actual rate is equal to the natural rate, there is no inflation. [2] "

Autumn Statement,"The Autumn Statement   made to Parliament by the UK chancellor of the Exchequer (or chief finance minister) once a year   is really a mini-Budget in which the chancellor outlines changes to fiscal policy. It is accompanied by a report from the Office for Budget Responsibility, which produces five-year forecasts for the UK economy twice a year. Once for the Budget (which the chancellor announces in the Spring) and once for the Autumn Statement which is usually in late November or at the beginning of December.   Autumn Statement in the news In his Autumn Statment on December 5 2012, the chancellor said the threshold for the 40 per cent rate would rise by 1 per cent in 2014 and again in 2015, from  41,450 to  41,865, and then to  42,285. There were also changes announced to the basic state pension, for home owners and for investors. There were no changes to the stamp duty land tax. On December 5 2013 the chancellor announced that the state pension age would rise to 68 in the mid-2030s and to 69 by the mid-2040s. Announcements also included the following: Stamp duty would be abolished for shares traded on exchange traded funds; Free school meals would be available for all children in the first three years of school; employers would no longer have to pay national insurance for workers under 21; the cap on the number of students who can go to university would be removed in 2015; there would be a freeze in fuel duty; the small business rate relief scheme would be extended; there would be a discount on business rates for small local retailers; the annual increase in business rates would be capped at 2 per cent and  1bn in loans would be made available to housing projects across the country.

B-share,"B-shares are shares issued domestically by Chinese companies and listed on either the Shanghai or Shenzhen stock exchanges. B-shares are reserved for foreign investors. A B-share's value is quoted in renminbi but trade is conducted in foreign currency. The first B-shares were issued in 1991. Although they attracted some interest they were always criticised for lack of liquidity with foreign investors usually preferring to trade in red-chip H-shares, listed in Hong Kong. The term B share can also be used to describe a share class. Companies can issue different classes of shares that might have different voting rights, for example. See A/B/C share.     B-share in the news In January 2013, an FT writer thought he could see the end in sight for China's ""zombie"" B-share market. China International Marine Containers became the first to convert its B-shares to H-shares.

BYOD,"BYOD stands for Bring Your Own Device and is used to refer to the growing trend of employees using their own smart phones, tablets or laptops in a work context. The explosion in the use of mobile devices has resulted in large numbers of employees working more than their allotted hours on their mobile devices. It has also resulted in increased security risks as information technology departments struggle to deal with encryption that works across multiple operating systems and careless employees.   BYOD in the news In November 2013, a writer in the FT considered the multiple problems posed by the BYOD trend. She pointed out that many companies had adopted a BYOD policy but that companies who had not thought about it had better accept that employees would be doing it anyway. Strategies a company could employ include a mobile device management (MDM), an emerging category of software which can do things such as wipe a device if it gets lost."
Balassa-Samuelson effect,"In 1964, academics Bela Balassa, a Hungarian economist, and Paul Samuelson, a Nobel-Laureate economist, independently observed that countries with higher levels of productivity growth experienced rapidly rising real wages and so appreciating real exchange rates. Academic studies since have suggested the picture is not as simple as Mr Balassa and Mr Samuelson first thought and that many other factors can also influence the model. However, many long term investors in emerging market currencies, for example, have been able to benefit from the appreciation of those currencies which is arguably due to the Balassa-Samuelson effect.   Balassa-Samuelson effect in the news In September 2012, investment managers were revealed to be at odds over how best to benefit from the Balassa-Samuelson effect. Record Currency Management, a fund manager, estimates revealed that between a third and a half of total unhedged return from EM equities was due to currency appreciation. However, the manager recommended a pure-play currency approach because of the risks of investing in either equities or bonds. An Aviva Investors manager thought that investing in bonds and T-bills offered a better way to gain exposure to the Balassa-Samuelson effect."
Balkanisation,"Balkanisation is a way to describe the breakdown of cross-border banking, as nervous lenders retreat in particular from the more troubled parts of the eurozone or at least try to isolate operations within national boundaries. The term stems from the historical break-up of the Balkans, whose national boundaries have fragmented at various points over the past 200 years. ExampleBetween 2008 and 2012, Balkanisation has made steady inroads across the sector. Nervous bank boards have sought to ringfence problems abroad and national regulators have encouraged them in their mission. It is a trend that has broader thinkers worried. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, has talked of the need to  repair this financial fragmentation . Mark Carney, head of the global regulatory body the Financial Stability Board, has warned that deglobalising finance will hurt growth and jobs by  reducing financial capacity and systemic resilience . In 2012, the process is under way on many fronts, as recent research reports from Barclays and Morgan Stanley have pointed out, with the most acute trends evident within the eurozone thanks to persistent nervousness about a break-up of the currency union.

Bank for International Settlements BIS,"Based in Basel, Switzerland, the Bank for International Settlements is a central bank for the central banks of the G10 countries. It was established in 1930 and its original function was to administer the reparation payments imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles. Since 1930 it has played a pivotal role fostering monetary policy co-operation, collecting and analysing financial data, as well as performing traditional banking functions for the central bank community, such as gold and foreign exchange transactions. It calls itself the world's oldest international financial organisation. It accepts deposits from its members and makes advances to them, while also operating as a forum for regular meetings aimed at ensuring the stability of the international monetary system. Its Basel committee for international banking supervision sets global standards for commercial banks' capital adequacy, called the Basel ratios.   Bank of International Settlements (BIS) in the news In June 2013 the BIS urged central banks to hold their nerve as they started to exit monetary easing policies even if there was volatility but stressed that it was not calling for an immediate tightening of monetary policy by all central banks."

The rules are set by a committee that meets in Basel, Switzerland, at the Bank for International Settlements. The first accord was reached in 1988 and its standards are widely followed throughout the world. The second accord, known as Basel 2 and first published in 2004, introduced risk weighting into the capital requirements for different activities. The Basel Committee now has nearly 30 member countries. [1] "
Basel Committee,"Made up of central bankers and regulators from 27 countries it lays down global rules for bank governance. Regulators around the world look to Basel for guidance on key issues, such as how much capital banks have to hold, relative to their loan and investment books.

Basel III,"Global banking regulators sealed a deal, in September of 2010, to effectively triple the size of the capital reserves that the world s banks must hold against losses, in one of the most important reforms to emerge from the financial crisis. The package, known as Basel III, sets a new key capital ratio of 4.5 per cent, more than double the current 2 per cent level, plus a new buffer of a further 2.5 per cent. Banks whose capital falls within the buffer zone will face restrictions on paying dividends and discretionary bonuses, so the rule sets an effective floor of 7 per cent.  The new rules will be phased in from January 2013 through to January 2019. Banks will be required to triple core tier one capital ratios from 2 per cent to 7 per cent by 2019. This ratio measures the buffer of highest quality capital that banks hold against future losses.The long-awaited agreement, developed by central bankers and officials, follows months of wrangling among the 27 member countries of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision over how to make banks more resilient to financial shocks. Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank and chairman of the negotiating group, called the deal  a fundamental strengthening of global capital standards ... Their contribution to long term financial stability and growth will be substantial.  Tougher capital standards are considered critical for preventing another financial crisis, but bankers had warned that if the new standards were too harsh or the implementation deadlines too short, lending could be curtailed, cutting economic growth and costing jobs. In addition to the 4.5 per cent core tier one ratio, and the 2.5 per cent buffer, the reform package also endorses the idea of an additional buffer of up to 2.5 per cent of core tier one capital to counter the economic cycle.

Big Society,"The most concise definition comes from Dame Helen Ghosh, Home Office permanent secretary.  We in [central] government need to focus on doing the things that only government can do,  she told MPs. Then  what we need to facilitate is that   at the most local, most individual level   people both identify and solve problems in the way that they wish to solve them . Even that, needless to say, begs more questions than it answers. New forms of finance are becoming available to help fund this  Big Society . The aim is to raise money that can help with social enterprise development but also tackle some of the issues with which society has long struggled by supplying upfront private investment at little or no risk to the public purse if the projects fail. For example, serious spending on dysfunctional families through parenting and childcare programmes can produce a huge pay-off in terms of lower crime rates and higher personal earnings. [1] But it will be built on the third sector It will. But the third sector, often used interchangeably with the voluntary sector, is riddled with jargon and with theological disputes about how to define it that makes gauging its size difficult. And the coalition now prefers the term  civic society  which includes faith organisations and trade unions. But it does include charities and social enterprises.What is a social enterprise There is not even agreement on that. Some insist a business must be non-profit to count as a social enterprise. Others include for-profit enterprises with some shareholders as long as their core goal is a social mission.So give me some examplesThe John Lewis Partnership, an employee-owned mutual, is probably the biggest and best known British social enterprise. By contrast Bupa, the health insurer, is a not-for-profit business, even if it behaves very much like a for-profit one, raising big sums from the City. It is technically a provident association, though few in the third sector would class it as a social enterprise, in spite of it fitting the rules.How far does the definition get stretched Andrew Lansley, health secretary, has tried to paint National Health Service foundation trusts as social enterprises on the grounds that their governing bodies are elected by patients, the public and staff, and they cannot distribute their surpluses. No one else in the movement sees them that way.Have any new ones emerged Yes. Some 700 nurses and other staff now work for Central Surrey Health in an employee-owned mutual that sells its services back to the NHS.And then there are membership-owned mutuals like building societies and Ebbsfleet football club, which was bought by its fans.Can it get more complicated It can. There are myriad ownership structures from mutuals, industrial and provident societies to provident associations and bodies like the Office of Public Management, which is an employee-owned consultancy with a public interest  lock  on its activities. [2] ExampleThe Big Society bank has been set up to boost investment in charities and social enterprises, which have struggled to attract cash from traditional lenders. It will be run independently from government and will provide wholesale lending to smaller investment groups, which will in turn invest in local groups.But the bank will have, at most, only  300m to invest in its first year. It also emerged that the government would need to secure approval from the European Commission, under state aid rules, to let the bank access up to  400m of unclaimed assets from dormant bank accounts.

Big Society Capital,"Big Society Capital is an entity formed by the UK government in 2012 to invest in UK projects that aim to have a positive social impact.

Big Society Capital has also been seeded with  50m each in capital injections from four high street banks   Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group and RBS   who each own 10 per cent of shares in Big Society Capital.

Volatility: On April 4 2013 a number of Bitcoin exchanges fell victim to hackers, causing its value to fall sharply. Six days later its value soared to an all-time high of $260 per bitcoin, before plummeting to $160 just six hours later.   Bitcoin in the news In April 2013 it was reported that the price of a Bitcoin had soared. In the first week of April it hit $147, a tenfold increase on what it cost in January 2013. Commentators believe that the tax on bank accounts in Cyprus spooked some people who jumped to buy untaxable, unfindable Bitcoins. Many also compared the sharp rise in value of the Bitcoins to a bubble and predicted there would be a crash in value. Meanwhile, there were concerns about hackers. In June 2013, it was announced that the US had decided to crack down on virtual currencies due to fears that Americans were using them to evade taxes. The announcement came after the news in May that five people associated with Liberty Reserve, a Costa Rican-based digital currrency  business, had been arrested on charges of running a $6bn money laundering scheme.

Asian countries including China had led the way in issuing warnings or declaring that the currency should not be accepted as legal tender. In Europe, regulators were watching developments and all eyes were on the US to see what it would make of the virtual currency's growing popularity. View: Bitcoin indepth page               "

Boglehead,"Bogleheads are those who follow the investment principles of Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard, the low-cost exchange traded fund (ETF) specialist. Boglehead principles aim at modest, simple, investment and savings plans. To invest like a Boglehead you should build a simple portfolio based on index investing. For example, a typical holding would be a stock market index tracking fund (either through a index tracking mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund), a global stock market index fund, and a bond index fund. Bogleheads, typically, do not favour alternative investments such as hedge funds. Bogleheads are also long-term investors and do not believe in trying to time the market. Bogleheads also, typically, try to minimise risk. Bogleheads have their own online community for sharing investment advice and other information.

Bretton Woods,"Landmark agreement signed at an international conference in 1944 at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, US, aimed at ensuring a stable monetary system after World World II, mainly through the use of fixed exchange rates. The agreement also established the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). [1] Bretton Woods refers to the international monetary arrangement, agreed upon by the allied nations in 1944 in Bretton Woods, US, that created the IMF and World Bank and that set up a system of fixed exchange rates with the US dollar as the international reserve currency. To provide credibility, the US agreed to exchange dollars for gold at a fixed price. In the early 1970s the US printed large amounts of dollars, presumably to help finance the Vietnam War, which led to large reductions in its holdings of gold as the international community traded dollars for gold. In 1971 President Nixon terminated the convertibility of the dollar to gold, which ended Bretton Woods. Since then, though, the dollar has maintained its dominance as the international reserve currency. ExamplePrior to Bretton Woods the international financial system suffered from currency manipulations as countries attempted to make their exports more competitive and from rising tariffs as countries attempted to protect their domestic industries following the Great Depression. A major objective of Bretton Woods was to promote financial stability by eliminating exchange rate manipulations and to lay the foundation for free trade. [2]"

CDO of ABS,These are collateralised cebt obligations (CDOs) developed out of asset-backed securities (ABS) which can be types of mortgage-backed bonds. [1]
CDO-squared,"The creation of securities known as CDOs (collateralised debt obligations) formed a new wave in the securitisation process. CDO issuers purchased different tranches of mortgage backed securities (MBS) and pooled them together with other asset-backed securities (ABS) - these are backed by car loans, student loans, credit card payments and other assets. They were tranched so  senior , CDOs were backed by highly rated MBS and other ABS, while  mezzanine  tranches pooled together a higher proportion of junior tranches. In contrast to an MBS where the underlying pool of assets was actual mortgages, in the case of CDOs the assets were the securities that received mortgage payments. CDOs, therefore, can be viewed as re-securitised securities. Once the pool of ABS and MBS were pooled, these then could be tranched and CDO securities could be issued via special purpose vehicles (SPVs) with varying risk-return and maturity profiles. Following on from this, SPVs could then construct portfolios comprising an array of CDOs and they could issue instruments backed by these portfolios of CDOs   these are known as CDO-squared. In theory the process could go on and on so long as investors had confidence in the collateral backing the securities. With the onset of the subprime criss and collapse in confidence in collateral valuation (linked to slumping property values) this resulted in a collapse of the CDO-squared and CDO market.  [1]"

CEO,See chief executive officer.
CEO duality,"CEO duality refers to the situation when the CEO also holds the position of the chairman of the board. The board of directors is set up to monitor managers such as the CEO on the behalf of the shareholders. They design compensation contracts and hire and fire CEOs. A dual CEO benefits the firm if he or she works closely with the board to create value. Establishing a unity of command at the head of the firm allows the firm to send a reassuring message to shareholders. However, it is also easier for the CEO to assert control of the board and consequently make it more difficult for shareholders to monitor and discipline the management. [1] Example Research in Motion, the maker of Blackberry, has a dual CEO/chairman. In fact, it has two co-chairmen (Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie), who are also co-CEOs, and one of whom is now CMO."
CEO succession,"CEO succession normally takes place in two steps: first is the decision to change CEO and next is the decision of selecting suitable candidates. CEO successors come from one of two sources: internal (insider CEOs), which refers to a new CEO promoted from within the organizational ranks, and external (outsider CEOs), which refers to a new CEO recruited from outside. Specifically, internal succession can take two forms -  heir succession  and  horse-race  succession. Heir succession, or so-called relay succession, is a planned succession in which a person (an heir) is appointed as a successor months or years before the incumbent CEO retires. Horse-race is a second type of internal succession in which current executives from the top management team compete for the top post (thus the term  race ). Compared to insider CEOs, CEOs recruited externally are less likely to maintain the status quo (strategic continuum) because they are often brought in by the board or key shareholders to effect organisational changes. Normally corporate boards are responsible for firing and hiring CEOs. Other than planning for succession and selecting a pool of candidates, corporate boards should also ensure smooth CEO transition to minimise the potential disruptions and turbulence to the entire organisation and its systems that come with changes at the top.  Succession planning should be a systematic process that allows firms to prepare for unplanned events  the sudden death of a CEO, for example. It is paramount that firms review their succession planning regularly. Bad financial performance is a primary trigger for involuntary CEO change (i.e., a dismissal). Although boards of directors have a fiduciary responsibility to initiate and oversee the succession process, not all boards are vigilant in their duty.  Powerful CEOs such as those with a long firm tenure and/or high equity ownership might be able to forestall their own dismissal from the board even when the firm faces severe financial distress. Research has also shown that the likelihood of a poor hiring decision can be higher when choosing a CEO outside the firm because boards of directors might not have full information about the external candidates. Because of its strategic importance, CEO succession can have an enormous impact on various dimensions of an organisation, such as employee morale, organisational culture, board composition, and financial performance. Example Firms might face a crisis situation after the departure of a powerful CEO with strong track records. Research has found that the announcement of CEO turnover in a well-performing firm could result in a negative reaction from the stock market. For example, Apple s shares dropped as much as 7 per cent in after-hours trade on the day Steve Jobs announced his resignation as Apple s CEO and chairman of the board in August 2011. Over the years, Steve Jobs has created legendary success for many of his company s product lines in the market. However, global investors had shown much concern for his health condition as he went on several medical leaves of absence over the past few years, sparking lots of discussions and speculation over Apple s succession plan and successor choice.

CFTC,"The CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) is an autonomous US body that oversees trading in derivatives like futures and options across a wide range of asset classes, such as commodities, energy and fixed income. It was created by the US Congress in 1974 when the majority of futures trading was in the agricultural sector. As financial markets have grown more complex it has seen its mandate expand repeatedly   most recently by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.    CFTC in the news In February 2011 a joint CFTC-SEC advisory committee created to investigate the May 2010 flash crash prompted an outcry among users of off-exchange trading venues by proposing changes that would benefit public exchanges at the expense of the off-exchange venues. The committee argued in a report that the use of such venues can deny critical liquidity to the public markets at times of stress, such as occurred during the flash crash. In June 2012 the chairman of the CFTC, Gary Gensler addressed Congress and launched a bristling attack on the integrity of the UK financial services industry. The comments raised hackles across the banking industry and were widely interpreted as a power grab by the CFTC. The CFTC led efforts in 2012 to look into possible Libor rate manipulation.  In November 2012, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission finalised key rules that are set to push more of the vast but opaque $640tn over-the-counter swaps market onto transparent trading venues."

CMBX,"The CMBX is an index, or more accurately a series of indices, designed to reflect the creditworthiness of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). In January 2013, Markit, the financial information services company and index provider, launched the  Markit CMBX.6, the sixth in the series after a five year hiatus with no new series launches. Series 1-5 referenced deals between 2005 and 2008.   CMBX in the news At the time of its launch in January 2013, the CMBX was expected to provide a boost to the CMBS market which was suffering from tight supply because older CMBS were maturing and new issues remained constrained. Issuers able to hedge their risk through the CMBX were expected to more quickly produce new CMBS. However, in April 2013, it was reported that the cost of insuring against losses on commercial mortgage backed securities had soared. While CMBS issuance had jumped to its best level since the financial crisis, the launch of the index also coincided with a rise in the interest rates that investors demanded on new CMBS. Some analysts attributed that rise to an unexpectedly sharp tumble in the value of the new index, and worried that its persistent weakness could pose a challenge to a slew of imminent CMBS deals. The cost of using the index as insurance against CMBS losses rises as its value declines."

Quant hedge fund strategies include CTAs, but CTAs by definition are more short term than some other quant strategies. They might be short one day and long the next and are less likely to have manager intervention. As such they have proved less popular with long term investors such as pension funds who might be worried about overall portfolio diversification.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (Cfius) is a government body that scrutinises foreign investment into the US and inbound foreign takeovers to assess potential threats to national security. [1]   Cfius in the news In early September 2013, Shuanghui International s $4.7bn acquisition of pork producer Smithfield Foods received clearance from the US Treasury department which reviewed the deal for national security concerns. The approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States paved the way for the largest ever Chinese takeover of a US company. The deal faced opposition from a bipartisan group of US lawmakers who were concerned about food security issues, including whether Chinese pork products could be exported to the US. But Smithfield and Shuanghui officials stressed that the deal was about sending Smithfield products to China to meet demand there. Cfius legal experts had expected the deal to win clearance from the US government because it did not raise significant national security issues. However, certain sectors still faced difficulties in gaining the go-ahead from government regulators. For example, Chinese oil companies in recent years acquired only minority stakes in assets of US oil and gas companies out of fear of raising the ire of US government regulators and politicians.

Chapter 10,"Chapter 10 of the US Bankruptcy Reform Act allows a business to reorganise under a court-appointed independent manager. [1] Chapter 10 allows small companies with financial problems to request court protection while a workable plan is devised to alleviate the situation. To qualify for protection under Chapter 10, a given company must fully disclose its current position to the court for review. In addition, the company must also be willing to develop a debt repayment schedule that will allow for orderly restitution of the outstanding debt. [2]"
Chapter 11,"Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Reform Act allows a voluntary reorganisation under existing management who negotiate with creditors. [1] When a business finds itself no longer able to service its debt or pay creditors, it has the option to file for protection under Chapter 11. Unlike Chapter 7, which requires a debtor to sell all non-exempt property, and then distribute the proceeds to creditors, Chapter 11, allows the debtor to remain in control of the business, subject to jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court. A bankruptcy plan is instituted by the Court.  To achieve a satisfactory resolution between both debtors and creditors - the details of which can be proposed by any interested party. Upon its confirmation, the plan becomes legally binding and sets out the treatment of debts and operations of the business for the duration of the plan.  [2]"
Chapter 13,"Chapter 13 of the US Bankruptcy Reform Act allows individuals to repay creditors over time, normally from future income. [1] An arrangement under U.S. bankruptcy legislation, where the debtor undertakes to reorganise their finances under the supervision and approval of the courts. As part of the reorganisation, the debtor must comply with a plan to repay outstanding creditors within three to five years. In most cases, the repayment plan must provide a substantial payback to creditors - and it must, if needed, use 100 per cent of the debtor's income for repayment. Chapter 13 bankruptcy differs from the outright foreclosure of an individual's or business's assets (seen in Chapter 7 bankruptcy) and the expensive restructuring of debts seen in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Essentially, Chapter 13 allows a debtor that still has significant income to submit an orderly plan to the courts to pay back debts over a few years. [2]"
Chapter 7,"Chapter 7 of the US Bankruptcy Reform Act deals with involuntary liquidation and provides for a court-appointed administrator. [1] Under Chapter 7, an applicant is required to sell all non-exempt property, and the resultant proceeds are then distributed to the creditors.

China's new five-year plan,"China s National People s Congress, held in March 2011 in Beijing, passed the 12th five-year plan for the period 2011 to 2015.  At the heart of the plan is the change of the economic model, from export and investment to more consumption-driven growth   meaning that Chinese consumers should spend more money and save less. ExampleThe approach will be combined with efforts to push environmental friendly production, to enlarge the service industry and to encourage R&D; activities   particularly in the high-tech industries. Moreover, the new plan will provide guidance for future efforts to reform the finance industry to ensure market driven interest rates, a flexible exchange rate mechanism and a convertible currency. To date, both China's interest rate and exchange rate are still controlled by the government. Last but not least, the promotion of the economic and social development in the underdeveloped west of the country will continue, particularly driven by ongoing urbanisation   this means bringing farmers to the cities. Definitely most challenging is the intended increase of domestic consumption. The disposable income is still low for most of the people in China, and Chinese citizens have to save a lot for risks such as sickness, unemployment, and retirement, for example. It follows that China has to build up a proper social security system, and this has to be accompanied by an increase in the income levels of individuals, especially those in the rural areas. This will boost spending and consumption. Both processes will surely take time. Overall it is expected that the plan will decrease the annual growth goal from the current 7.5% to 7%. [2]"

Coll,"The Collective Investment Schemes sourcebook (Coll), the Financial Services Authority's (FSA) book of fund rules, defines the limitations on UK-regulated unit trusts. It replaced CIS, the previous sourcebook on collective investment schemes, in 2007.

Both the Ucits and non-Ucits retail schemes can be marketed to retail investors. [2]"
Collateralised debt obligation CDO,"A collateralised debt obligation, CDO, is a tradeable derivative whose income payments and principal repayments are dependent on a pool of different financial instruments which themselves are loans and are due to pay interest and ultimately be repaid. CDOs are called collateralised because the promised repayment of the loans are the collateral that gives the CDOs value.  In the case of CDOs, mortgages might be packaged with other loans, bonds or instruments. The different financial instruments are gathered together into a special purpose entity or special purpose vehicle and divided into tranches. Senior tranches pay the lowest interest rates but are the safest investment because should there be any default, seniors are paid first. The most junior tranches would attract the highest interest rates but suffer the highest risk should the holder of an underlying loan default. CDOs are effectively promises to pay investors in a prescribed sequence.   collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) in the news Collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) hit the news at the time of the US subprime mortgage crisis of 2006-2007 which precipitated the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. When house buyers   who should never have been offered mortgages because they were unlikely ever to be able to repay their loans   began to default on their loans, losses spread to the collateralised debt obligation market. In February 2013 the US Department of Justice accused ratings agency Standard & Poor's of defrauding investors in mortgage-related securities out of at least $5bn. In a lawsuit it alleged that from 2004 until 2007, S&P; ""adjusted and delayed"" updates to its ratings criteria and models and continued to churn out Triple A ratings on mortgage related securities including collateralised debt obligations."

Cross of Gold speech," This refers to a political speech delivered by former Congressman and prospective US presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on July 9 1896.  The speech concludes:  If they dare to come out in the open field and defend the gold standard as a good thing, we shall fight them to the uttermost, having behind us the producing masses of the nation and the world. Having behind us the commercial interests and the laboring interests and all the toiling masses, we shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to them, you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.  The speech is relevant to monetary economics and international finance today because it illustrates the potential impact of, and political struggle regarding, exchange rates.  Within a particular country s economy, individuals and businesses with debts or other fixed obligations such as labor contracts tend to benefit from inflation, that is, a cheap currency. Importers and consumers prefer an expensive currency. Across countries, an economy which depends on export sales can benefit if its currency is cheap, thereby making its products attractive to foreign customers. This tension can lead to inconsistent preferences even among the same group in the economy.  Consumers, for example, will want a cheap currency to boost their prospects for working in export dependent industries but will want an expensive currency that allows them to consume more foreign products.  The context of the speech is the long political struggle to return the United States to a single metallic monetary standard after decades of uncertainty that began with the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 and the issuance of paper money ( greenbacks ) by the US Treasury that was not convertible into gold or silver. At points, particularly during the war, greenbacks traded at a substantial discount to gold coins. In the 1890s, the choice was between a gold standard and a silver standard. Because silver was considered a relatively cheap metal, it was believed that a silver currency would benefit debtors by allowing them to reduce their debts at relatively modest costs. Silver was also believed to benefit farmers and manufacturers whose products, priced in cheap silver money, would appeal to foreign customers. In contrast, importers, individuals and businesses who saved, and others, held an opposing opinion, preferring a gold monetary standard. The speech is viewed as populist because of the belief that farmers, small businessmen, debtors, and the  little man  would suffer under a gold standard. Several months after the speech was delivered, Republican candidate William McKinley defeated Bryan and won the presidency.  The gold standard was adopted afterwards. [1] "

Dodd-Frank Act,"In 2010, the US Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the largest financial regulation overhaul since the 1930s. Named after its Democratic sponsors in Congress, Senator Chris Dodd and Representative Barney Frank, the law aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. The 2000-page act included sweeping new rules for banks, hedge funds and complex financial transactions called derivatives. The act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect retail users of banking products and a new Financial Stability Oversight Council to watch for looming threats to the financial system. US regulators are in the process of churning out hundreds of new rules that cover everything from limiting proprietary trading (taking bets with a bank s own money rather than for clients) to regulating swaps dealers. US president Barack Obama, who signed the act into law, said:  The American people will never again be asked to foot the bill for Wall Street s mistakes,  but many in the financial services sector say the law and accompanying regulations are confusing, expensive and in some cases unworkable. [1] The Dodd-Frank initiative is one of a number of transparency initiatives (see also Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative, EU Accounting and Transparency Directive and CRD IV). Dodd-Frank will require companies active in the extractives industry that file annual reports with the US Securities Exchange Commission to report all payments made to governments. Revised proposed rules were issued by the Securities Exchange Commission in December 2015 and a vote to approve the final rules is expected in June 2016.

Dogecoin,"Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency, or virtual, electronic currency, that was introduced at the beginning of December 2013.

Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin's founders are not anonymous. Dogecoin was created by an American programmer called Billy Markus and  Jackson Palmer who works for Adobe in Australia. Dogecoin's early popularity probably springs from its association with the internet meme Doge, which sees internet users superimpose broken English phrases in colourful script over manipulated images of a Shiba Inu dog. Doge is not only the inspiration behind the creation of the ""look"" of the currency, the meme also seems to underpin some of the philosophy of the Dogecoin community. Dogecoin's viral popularity also contributed to another problem   disagreements on how to pronounce it. Here is cofounder Jackson Palmer explaining what he had in mind in a YouTube video.   Dogecoin in the news In January 2014 Dogecoin users got together to raise money to send the Jamaica bobsleigh team to the Winter Olympics in Sochi. In February 2014 Jackson Palmer announced that Dogecoin would be an inflationary currency, unlike Bitcoin which has a hard cap on the total number of coins in existence and therefore encourages hoarding. The decision to keep adding coins to circulation was simultaneously welcomed and derided."

Dutch disease,"Dutch disease is the negative impact on an economy of anything that gives rise to a sharp inflow of foreign currency, such as the discovery of large oil reserves. The currency inflows lead to currency appreciation, making the country s other products less price competitive on the export market. It also leads to higher levels of cheap imports and can lead to deindustrialisation as industries apart from resource exploitation are moved to cheaper locations.The origin of the phrase is the Dutch economic crisis of the 1960s following the discovery of North Sea natural gas. [1]   Dutch disease in the news In March 2009, an FT story considered the effects of oil revenues on the United Arab Emirates and looked at whether they had been able to avoid Dutch disease. The writer found that attempts to invest some of the windfall profits from oil in the domestic economy had backfired because too much of the investment had been in property, unlike in Saudi Arabia,  where authorities did not allow banks to overlend. At the end of January 2014, a writer for Beyond Brics said Mongolia was facing the classic symptoms of Dutch disease   as resource exports rose, so too would the value of its currency, driving down competitiveness in other sectors."

EMBI,"The EMBI (Emerging Market Bond Index) is JP Morgan's index of dollar-denominated sovereign bonds issued by a selection of emerging market countries. [1]The family of EMBI is the most widely used and comprehensive emerging market sovereign debt benchmark. In addition to serving as a benchmark to measure the performance of the asset class, the indices define and increase the visibility of the emerging market sovereign debt market and provide a list of the instruments traded along with a compilation of their terms. ExamplesThere are three different EMBI indices produced by J.P. Morgan's Global Index Research group: EMBI+, EMBI Global, and EMBI Global Diversified. The indices are rule-based with specific liquidity, maturity and structural constraints.     Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (EMBI+): This tracks total returns for traded external debt instruments (external meaning foreign currency denominated fixed income) in the emerging markets. EMBI+ covers US dollar-denominated Brady bonds, loans and Eurobonds. The EMBI+ expands upon J.P.Morgan's original Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI), which was introduced in 1992 and covered only Brady bonds. Instruments in the EMBI+ must have a minimum face value outstanding of $500 million and must meet strict criteria for secondary market trading liquidity.   EMBI Global: The J.P.Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global (""EMBI Global"") tracks total returns for traded external debt instruments in the emerging markets, and is an expanded version of the EMBI+. As with the EMBI+, the EMBI Global includes US dollar-denominated Brady bonds, loans, and Eurobonds with an outstanding face value of at least $500 million. However, instead of selecting countries according to a sovereign credit-rating level (as it is done with EMBI+), the EMBI Global defines emerging markets countries with a combination of World Bank-defined per capita income brackets and each country's debt-restructuring history. These two criteria allow the EMBI global to include a number of higher-rated countries. Also, EMBI Global's secondary market liquidity constraints are much more relaxed than EMBI+, and results in inclusion of nearly twice as many instruments than the EMBI+.   EMBI Global Diversified: This limits the weights of countries with larger debt stocks by only including a specified portion of these countries' eligible current face amounts of debt outstanding.   The EMBI family of indices was launched in the summer of 1999 and historical daily data has been backfilled to December 1993. In July of 1999, the three largest constituents of the EMBI Global were Argentina 20.4%, Brazil 19.2% and Mexico, 15.2%. On December 31, 2010, the three largest constituents were Mexico, 11.84%; Russia, 11.60% and Brazil, 10.44%. Argentina represented only 2.08% of the 2010 capitalization. [2]"

EMBI+ covers US dollar-denominated Brady bonds, loans and Eurobonds. The EMBI+ expands upon J.P.Morgan's original Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI), which was introduced in 1992 and covered only Brady bonds. Instruments in the EMBI+ must have a minimum face value outstanding of $500 million and must meet strict criteria for secondary market trading liquidity.   EMBI Global: The J.P.Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global (""EMBI Global"") tracks total returns for traded external debt instruments in the emerging markets, and is an expanded version of the EMBI+. As with the EMBI+, the EMBI Global includes US dollar-denominated Brady bonds, loans, and Eurobonds with an outstanding face value of at least $500 million. However, instead of selecting countries according to a sovereign credit-rating level (as it is done with EMBI+), the EMBI Global defines emerging markets countries with a combination of World Bank-defined per capita income brackets and each country's debt-restructuring history. These two criteria allow the EMBI global to include a number of higher-rated countries. Also, EMBI Global's secondary market liquidity constraints are much more relaxed than EMBI+, and results in inclusion of nearly twice as many instruments than the EMBI+.   EMBI Global Diversified: This limits the weights of countries with larger debt stocks by only including a specified portion of these countries' eligible current face amounts of debt outstanding.   The EMBI family of indices was launched in the summer of 1999 and historical daily data has been backfilled to December 1993. In July of 1999, the three largest constituents of the EMBI Global were Argentina 20.4%, Brazil 19.2% and Mexico, 15.2%. On December 31, 2010, the three largest constituents were Mexico, 11.84%; Russia, 11.60% and Brazil, 10.44%. Argentina represented only 2.08% of the 2010 capitalization. [2]"

ESG,"ESG (environmental, social and governance) is a generic term used in capital markets and used by investors to evaluate corporate behaviour and to determine the future financial performance of companies. ESG factors are a subset of non-financial performance indicators which include sustainable, ethical and corporate governance issues such as managing the company s carbon footprint and ensuring there are systems in place to ensure accountability.   adoption of ESG principles The European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies (EFFAS) has defined topical areas for the reporting of ESG issues, and developed Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for use in financial analysis of corporate performance. EFFAS has identified nine topical areas that apply to all sectors and industries: 1) Energy efficiency; 2) Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; 3) Staff turnover; 4) Training & qualification; 5) Maturity of workforce; 6) Absenteeism rate; 7) Litigation risks; 8) Corruption; 9) Revenues from new products. Next to these nine areas sector-specific ESGs and KPIs (key performance indicators) have also been defined. [1] ESG has quickly become part of investment jargon to describe the performance of investment and fund portfolios on environmental, social and governance criteria and the quality of their performance against measurable ESG factors that are reported to shareholders. ESG analysis can provide insight into the long-term prospects of companies which allows mispricing opportunities to be identified. Investors can find new market opportunities with companies that place the management of ESG factors at the core of the business. Company-specific ESG factors offer a benchmark for investors to judge the overall quality of the board s governance and risk management processes and their positioning within an industry sector. The UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI) provides a voluntary ESG framework for companies and funds, from which investors can make informed investment decisions that relate to sustainability and governance practices. The growing interest in ESG factors from institutional investors, in particular, reflects the view that environmental, social and corporate governance issues can affect the performance of investment portfolios and should therefore be given appropriate consideration by investors. As of February 2014, 1,064 asset owners and asset managers and 183 professional service partners, representing combined assets of more than $34 trillion, had committed themselves to the six principles of the PRI. The six principles of the PRI are: 1. We will incorporate ESG issues into investment analysis and decision-making processes 2. We will be active owners and incorporate ESG issues into our ownership policies and practices 3. We will seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the entities in which we invest 4. We will promote acceptance and implementation of the Principles within the investment industry 5. We will work together to enhance our effectiveness in implementing the Principles 6. We will each report on our activities and progress towards implementing the Principles Fund managers and financial analysts who can interpret and relate ESG factors to a company s future prospects may potentially develop a competitive advantage should others fail to recognise the same risks or opportunities related to those factors. The Association of British Insurers, in its guidelines to institutional investors, expects that a company s annual report should include information on ESG-related risks and opportunities that may significantly affect the company s short and long term value, and how such risks and opportunities might impact on the future of the business. The annual report should also set out how the board fulfils its responsibilities for ESG policies, procedures and verification. [2]   ESG in the news In October 2013 an FT columnist wrote that although the $34tn of assets backing the UN's Principles for Responsible Investment ought to be invested to take account of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors that in practice it was hard to see what difference the UNPRI was making. The piece drew a response from the managing director of the UNPRI who wrote that the organisation had developed a new framework which would require members for the first time to give evidence to demonstrate exactly how they were managing their investments in line with the Principles."

EU directives on accounting and transparency,"The EU Directives on Accountancy and Transparency includes rules which comprise one of a number of transparency initiatives (see also Dodd-Frank, and CRD IV), The rules in the Accounting Directive are aimed at certain EU entities active in the extractives and logging industries, and will require various payments to governments to be reported on a country by country basis. Domestic legislation to implement the terms of the directive into the law of individual Member States should have been enacted by 20 July 2015, though not all States met this deadline. In the UK, reporting is required for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2015. The Transparency Directive extends the provisions of the Accounting Directive to all companies in the extractives and logging sector that are listed on recognised exchanges in the EU, irrespective of their country of incorporation or registration. Again, legislation to transpose this into the domestic law of Member States should have been enacted in 2015. [1]    "
EU emissions trading scheme,"This is also known as EU ETS.  The European Union greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme was born on January 1 2005, and covers carbon dioxide emissions from six sectors of heavy industry, including electricity generation, steel-making, cement-making, pulp and paper, and glass. Companies covered by the scheme may emit only a certain quota of carbon dioxide each year, and are issued with carbon permits for every tonne of the quota. They can trade these permits with each other. In successive phases of the scheme, the quota is reduced so that the overall emissions fall. [1]"
EU structural funds,"This is the EU's flagship development programme which is designed to narrow the gap between the rich and poor parts of Europe. More than one third of the total EU budget,  347bn, goes to structural and cohesion funds, which contribute funding to everything from roads and bridges to employee training.Overall, the policy aims to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the European Union by reducing the differences in development between regions.  The majority of that spending is allocated to three funds: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion fund.ERDF is predominantly intended to support infrastructure projects and to invest in companies, in particular small and medium enterprises.ESF funds programmes are designed to help unemployed people into work, promote lifelong learning and to combat discrimination in the labour market. The Cohesion Fund aims to reduce the economic and social shortfall of regions where the gross national income per capita is less than 90 per cent of the EU average. These funds are overseen by two Directorates General in Brussels:  DG Regional Policy;   DG Employment, Social Affairs and Equal OpportunitiesThey approve the overall strategy of the member states  expenditure and are also responsible that the control and audit systems of the member states are well designed.But the day to day operation and selection of all projects happens at the member state level. Each member state has several managing authorities that are in charge of administering the funds through operational programmes. The member states present proposals on what these programmes should achieve based on overall objectives set for the Cohesion Policy, and they are very closely aligned to the Lisbon strategy.The  managing authorities  in turn decide on which individual projects and beneficiaries should receive support. Operational programmes must be co-financed by the member states and there are rules that allow programmes to receive different levels of support through structural funds.So for example, in regions with per capita GDP below 75 per cent of the EU average, the amount that comes from the EU for an operational programme can be   in some cases   up to 85 per cent of the total funding for a particular project.So, how does it work at the member state level After the Commission approves Operational Programmes it pays the  pre-financing  amount.The managing authority then starts the selection and financing process. Apart from the managing authorities, two other bodies are involved:  The certification body, which ensures that claims to the Commission are free of errors  The audit authority, which ensures that the control and management systems work, and they also check whether the projects comply with EU regulations.Once the Commission is happy that the system works, it makes an interim payment. Then the member state (through the certification body) make claims for payments three times a year. The funds have to be spent within two years   or three years for some member states   of having been received.

Emir - European Market Infrastructure Regulation,"The European Market Infrastructure Regulation, or Emir, is Europe's response to a G20 committment made in Pittsburgh in 2009 to overhaul the off-exchange derivatives market. Global policy wanted to safeguard financial markets from the huge and frequently uninsured one-way positions in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that went unnoticed in the run-up to the financial crisis until it was too late. The principles underpinning it were agreed by European authorities in early 2012 although regulators are still working on the fine details that will govern their daily operations. The Emir regulation requires more OTC derivatives to be backed by processed through clearing houses and be backed by collateral. Trades also have to be reported to authorities via trade repositories. While there are many similarities between the European regulation and its US counterpart, the Dodd-Frank act, there are also crucial differences. US and European authorities have differing views on minimum amounts of margin that clearing houses must hold and who reports completed trades.   Emir in the news In September 2013 an FT writer commented that there had many difficulties bringing in the new regulations. Interdealer brokers have most to lose, he wrote, because of their long-term role acting as middlemen moving large blocks of illiquid securities.  The interdealer brokers, such as ICAP, Tullett Prebon and GFI Group argued the reforms would simply institutionalise a role they already fulfil."

In 2012, the FSA in its settlement documents with Barclays over its manipulation of Libor alleged that a senior euro swaps trader at Barclays would have daily conversations with traders at the other banks that submitted rates to determine Euribor. In these phone calls, emails or instant messages, the traders allegedly agreed to contact submitters at their respective banks to pressure them into submitting a rate that would benefit their derivatives positions.

European Monetary Fund,"Germany and France are planning to launch a sweeping new initiative to reinforce economic co-operation and surveillance within the eurozone, including the establishment of a European Monetary Fund (EMF), according to senior government officials. Their intention is to set up the rules and tools to prevent any recurrence of instability in the eurozone stemming from the indebtedness of a single member state, such as Greece. The first details of the plan, including support for an EMF modelled on the International Monetary Fund, were revealed by Wolfgang Sch uble, the German finance minister. The fund would have resources to lend to eurozone member states in financial difficulty, but only subject to very strict conditions to curb excessive budget deficits and borrowing. The idea was proposed by Germany and they are now trying to get France on board. [1] Why has Germany suddenly proposed a European Monetary Fund The turmoil over Greece s public finances has shown Europe s monetary union, which today has 16 member states, ill equipped to manage crises. The debt problems of one of the eurozone s smallest economies have threatened the stability of the entire region because it was unclear what might happen in a worst case scenario.Behind the scenes, eurozone politicians have been considering the lessons. Establishing a European Monetary Fund could reduce uncertainty   bail-out procedures would have been agreed in advance   thus preventing crises from spinning out of control.How would such a fund work So far, the German finance ministry has provided few details. But ideas were provided in a paper published in February 2010 by Daniel Gros, director of the Brussels-based Centre for European Policy Studies, and Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Deutsche Bank. They proposed funding the EMF out of levies on countries that breached European Union fiscal rules (thus increasing the incentive to comply), supplemented by borrowing in the markets. If such a fund had been launched with the euro in 1999, the two authors calculated, it would have accumulated  120bn ($163bn,  108bn) by now   enough to rescue a small-to-medium-sized eurozone member. In a crisis, a country could call on funds up to the amount it had paid in, providing its fiscal policies were approved by other eurozone members. Help beyond that amount would entail a supervised  adjustment programme . [2] ViewEuropean Monetary Fund Q&A;"

FAS 157,"FAS 157, or Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 157, was the original name for Topic 820   the fair value standard which became effective in late 2007. Also known as the  mark-to-market rule,  it requires funds to fair value securities rather than rely on historical prices to value securities. The standard mandates that firms rank securities on a scale of 1 to 3, with  1  being those securities with the most easily identifiable prices and  3  being the least transparent and most difficult to price. Those securities labeled a  2  have prices that are not directly observable and need to be compared to similar assets with prices that can be observed. [1]"

FDIC,Abbreviation for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. [1] 
FDIC-style resolution,"Since the 1930s, ""resolution"" is what the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) does when a bank it insures fails.  FDIC bank supervisors determine that the bank s assets are worth less than its liabilities. The bank itself is shut down and its assets are transferred to a new entity controlled by the FDIC.  This is a form of bankruptcy process managed by a government agency - with the responsibility to manage an orderly liquidation and to avoid losses to insured retail depositors.The FDIC attempts to maximize the value of the assets it acquires, typically by selling them to another bank or banks. From the customers  standpoint, little changes during this period: the branches, ATM machines, web site and so on remain in operation during the transition, except that customer may not be able to withdraw amounts above the insurance limits.If the proceeds do not cover the bank s liabilities, the creditors lose out, but the FDIC makes sure that all the insured deposits are paid back. Note that going into conservatorship does not mean that the bank is consolidated onto the government balance sheet; the liabilities are not automatically guaranteed.The FDIC previously implemented resolution only for banks with insured retail deposits, but under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, the FDIC is empowered to use the same process for bank holding companies and other financial institutions.  It remains to be seen how this will be implemented for very large cross-border banks, particularly as there is no cross-border counterpart of the FDIC s resolution approach. [1]"

Fabulous Fab,"Fabulous Fab was the name given to Fabrice Tourre, a former Goldman Sachs derivatives salesman. In July 2013 a civil trial started against him in the US in which the SEC alleged that he misled investors in a mortgage-related security. The SEC's case rested partly on an email writted by Mr Tourre to his girlfriend who also worked in the bank. In the email, sent in 2007 which he wrote that the whole building was about to collapse and the sole survivor would be  the fabulous Fab (as Mitch would kindly call me, even though there is nothing fabulous [about] me, just kindness, altruism and deep love for some gorgeous super-smart French girl in London), standing in the middle of all these complex, highly levered, exotic trades he created without necessarily understanding all the implications of those monstrosities     The SEC also alleged that Mr Tourre knew of an undisclosed short interest by hedge fund Paulson in the Abacus 2007-AC1 CDO, and that he misled other parties into believing that Paulson's investment was a long one. Mr Tourre was the only individual Goldman banker to face an SEC lawsuit. On August 1 2013, a federal jury found Fabrice Tourre liable for defrauding investors in the derivatives deal. The decision marked the end of a three-year effort by the SEC against Mr Tourre."
Facebook fatigue,"Facebook fatigue is a term increasingly used by investors to describe mounting anecdotal evidence that young people are leaving Facebook.

Nonetheless, two thirds of online adults were Facebook users.   Facebook fatigue in the news In May 2013 investment analysts were looking at Facebook's prospects as it prepared to mark its first year as a public company. A report said concerns ran high because people in their teens and early 20s will be critical for Facebook's future.

Fatca,"On 17 January 2013, the US issued final regulations regarding new anti-tax avoidance measures called the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca). The new rules will force all global financial companies to report details of US account holders with more than $50,000 to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the US tax authority. US tax authorities expect the measures to raise around $7.6bn in revenue for the IRS over a 10-year period. Foreign firms with US investors as clients will be impacted by the new rules. The deadline for foreign firms to enter into an agreement with the IRS is 25 October 2013 in order to be included on the IRS s list of compliant institutions in December 2013. Several jurisdictions have already brokered deals, or intergovernmental agreements, with the US Treasury which are designed to ease the burden of compliance for firms operating in those countries. There are two models for these agreements.  One involves firms reporting directly to the IRS on their clients, while the other allows firms to report to their domestic tax bodies who pass on information to the IRS. The UK, Ireland, Denmark, Mexico have signed intergovernmental agreements with the US, while Spain and Switzerland have  initialled  but not released details. France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada, Finland, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Jersey, the Netherlands and Norway are expected to conclude talks with US tax authorities shortly. [1] In September 2012 the UK signed an agreement with the US to implement the reporting required under US FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) legislation, which requires automatic exchange of bank and other financial account information on US citizens and entities. Similar agreements have since been entered into between other states and a model set of agreements has been developed to facilitate this sharing, in the form of the common reporting standard (CRS). [2] Fatca historical background The Fatca rules, quietly passed by Congress in 2012, would partly put the responsibility on the bank or asset manager   not just the individual   to make this filing. This legislation aims to tackle offshore tax evasion. The IRS insists that these measures are simple for banks and asset managers to implement; they just need to perform an electronic  sweep  of their clients to track those with more than $50,000 in an account and obvious connections with the US, such as an address, Treasury officials argue. The new rules leave some financial officials fuming in places such as Australia, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong and Singapore. Little wonder. Never mind the fact that implementing these measures is likely to be costly; in jurisdictions such as Singapore or Hong Kong, the IRS rules appear to contravene local privacy laws.What has left some financiers doubly angry is that Congress introduced the law with little overseas consultation   but the IRS is now threatening heavy penalties for non-compliance. More specifically, the IRS is threatening to impose a withholding tax of up to 30 per cent on sales of US assets by groups that it deems to be  non-compliant    and the assets could include US shares or US Treasury bonds.Hence the fact that some non-US asset managers and banking groups are debating whether they could simply ignore Fatca by creating subsidiaries that never touch US assets at all. [3]   Fatca in the news At the end of 2012 it was revealed that a draft agreement drawn up by the UK Treasury would require automatic disclosure of information revealing full details of all account holders in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Although it would shatter secrecy at least one observer thought the offshore jurisdictions would be forced to sign up or no bank with a US presence would be able to do business there. During 2012, investment industry groups were lobbying for extra time to comply and warning of the huge extra costs that would be involved.

Financial Policy Committee  FPC,"The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) is the UK s risk regulator formed in early 2011, charged with overseeing the stability of the financial system. The committee is given tough powers to tame systemic risk by clamping down on loose credit, overheated sectors and previously unregulated parts of the financial system. The committee, housed in the Bank of England (BoE) and chaired by the Bank's governor Mervyn King, is viewed as a counterpart to the monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates.  The FPC will be part of the BoE and staffed with six BoE executives, the head of the new regulator and four external members. Whereas the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is responsible for making interest rate decisions based on changes in the macroeconomic environment, the FPC is more of a regulatory body for the City. In this regard it signals the end of the previous  tripartite  system of sharing regulatory responsibility between the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority, and the Treasury. It comprises internal and external members and has two main tasks. The first is to monitor overall or systemic risks to the financial system (macro-prudential), and the second is to regulate individual groups within it (micro-prudential). In order to do this the FPC is identifying and analysing potential policy instruments. As a  macro-prudential  regulator, the new committee will focus on financial stability. It will have the power to impose broad policy changes on the Prudential Regulatory Authority, which will regulate individual banks. The body is part of the UK coalition government's regulatory revamp, designed to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis. ExampleThe FPC could raise bank capital requirements if it thinks the economy is overheating, or place loan-to-value limits on mortgages. It could also limit overall bank borrowing or control specific kinds of lending by imposing higher collateral requirements, called  haircuts . [1] One of the tools proposed for the FPC comes directly out of the global Basel III bank reform package. The so-called  counter-cyclical buffer  allows national regulators who are worried about an overheating economy to require local banks to hold extra capital. Regulators in other countries are then expected to require their local banks to hold extra capital against any business they do in the overheating country.

For anyone who sits the GMAT, the test score is valid for up to five years. The GMAT is offered in 110 counties and it costs $250 to sit the test. The test is administered by Pearson Vue. (Pearson also owns the Financial Times.) More than 200,000 business school applicants sit the test every year, with more than 50 per cent of those applicants resident outside the US . In recent years the GRE test (graduate record examination) has provided increased competition to the GMAT. The GRE is a general test for those wanting to go to graduate school   be it in engineering, philosophy or the arts.  [1]ViewThe Financial Times MBA Basics homepage"

Gartenberg standard,"The long-established U.S. legal standard is a way to determine whether a mutual fund adviser has breached its fiduciary duty under Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act by allowing a fund to charge excessive fees. The Standard, which was created in 1982, rejects the notion that a fund s fees are excessive just because the fees of competing funds are lower. Several factors that a court should consider when applying the Gartenberg standard are: the adviser s cost in providing its service, the nature and quality of the service, to what extent an adviser achieves economies of scale and the volume of orders that must be processed. Gartenberg to face liability under 36(b), an investment adviser must charge a fee that is so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm s-length bargaining.

Giffen good,"A Giffen good, in economic theory, is a good that is in greater demand as its price increases. For example, if the price of an essential food staple, such as rice, rises it may mean that consumers have less money to buy more expensive foods, so they will actually be forced to buy more rice. Giffen goods are named after Sir Robert Giffen who wrote that he observed this purchasing behaviour in the Victorian poor. Giffen goods differ from Veblen goods which also experience rising demand at the same time as rising prices but in this case the rising price fuels their demand. Veblen goods are luxury items while Giffen goods are staple items.   Giffen goods in the news In August 2011 an FT Alphaville post considered how quantitative easing could become a deflationary force and pump money into a liquidity trap where banks were more interested in capital preservation than in yield. In such a situation demand would grow for government bonds and turn them into a Giffen good. "

Glass-Steagall Act,"When US officials talk of ""restoring Glass-Steagall"", they mean the Banking Act of 1933, which sought to prevent a repeat of the mass bank collapses seen in the Great Depression.  Sponsored by Henry Steagall and Carter Glass, it was largely a reaction to the perception that banks had run itno trouble through their securities business. Some had lost by investing in speculative securities, some had made companies in which they had invested and others had pressed customers to invest in securities they were distributing. Government protection was provided for depositors, whose funds were walled off from the activities of the securities business. Glass-Steagall created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and imposed conditions on the banks that received its protection. These banks, deemed to be commercial banks, were barred from underwriting and distributing the securities of private companies. Commercial banks could not own or be closedly affiliated with a brokerage business.  Then, in 1956, the Bank Holding Company Act barred them from underwritng insurance. However, the restrictions were gradually narrowed and the law repealed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999.  [1]"

H-shares,"H-shares are shares of mainland Chinese companies traded on the Hong Kong stock exchange and denominated in Hong Kong dollars. Many of the companies listed in Hong Kong trade simultaneously on mainland Chinese stock exchanges. H-shares are seen as more liquid and less volatile than Chinese-listed A-shares and B-shares.   H-shares in the news In March 2013 it was reported that H-shares were underperforming woefully along with stock of western companies whose revenues are exposed to China. The underperformance was attributed to the fact that China's growth, while still brisk compared to western countries, was slowing. The sluggish performance of H-shares was a little surprising to some who had expected a poor performance in Chinese A-shares, which suffered a bubble in 2007 and shattered the confidence of the domestic investors permitted to invest in them. In February 2013, the FT's Lex team commented that the H-shares of Ping An, the Chinese insurer, were up only half as much as its Shanghai-based A-shares since the Chinese market went on a tear in December, while Hong Kong-listed China stocks have generally gained only a third less over that time.

HICP,"The European Central Bank monitors its success in controlling inflation in the eurozone by the so-called harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP). The HICP is a common measure of inflation across the eurozone. It replaced each country s longstanding national consumer prices index, or CPI. Common definitions were necessary to judge whether countries could be judged to have satisfied the Maastricht criteria for monetary union that included inflation. ExampleBut while the harmonised index produced broadly comparable measures of inflation, some items were missing - the major one being the costs associated with owner-occupation. But as in other economies there has been much debate about whether such inflation measures should include owner-occupiers  housing costs. The omission was described in a Eurostat manual on consumer prices, published in June 2008, as  the major shortcoming  in the currently published CPIs. The ECB shares that perspective; home owners could see their housing costs rise substantially without the effects showing up in headline inflation measures. The purchase price of the property is one part of it but there was also an enthusiasm to include buying and selling costs, mortgage expenses, legal fees and some taxes.

Heartbleed bug,"A security flaw found in an encryption method widely used on websites, including Facebook, Google and Yahoo  potentially exposing web traffic, sensitive user data and content, such as passwords, to cyber criminals. The Heartbleed bug was found in the OpenSSL software by security researchers from Google Security and Codenomicon - a security testing company - in April 2014, prompting large technology companies to fix their systems. On the heartbleed.com website, the researchers described the bug as allowing attackers  to eavesdrop on communications, steal data directly from the services and users and to impersonate services and users . However, they believe that the flaw has been in the software since December 2011. Cyber security experts have recommended that users of affected services change their passwords after the service has updated its software. OpenSSL released an update to repair the flaw and companies had to update their software to be safe. The gap between the announcement of the flaw and a company updating its software however, is a critical moment, providing a window for cyber criminals to pounce.  But even those who fix the software cannot necessarily see if a hacker has taken advantage of the vulnerability to access their systems. Netcraft, which monitors what code is used in each site, said more than half a million trusted websites were vulnerable to the bug. Above image credit: Reuters   Heartbleed bug in the news In 2014, the first arrest of a hacker accused of exploiting the Heartbleed bug was announced by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The Canadian police force s cyber crime unit said it had charged a man from Ontario in relation to the malicious breach of taxpayer data from the Canada Revenue Agency website - the country s tax authority. The agency said that the social insurance numbers of about 900 taxpayers had been stolen as a result of the vulnerability. In the same year, American Funds, one of the world s largest mutual fund providers, became the first financial institution to warn that its customers may be at risk from the security flaw which made much of the web vulnerable to cyber criminals. Investors using the site between December 12, 2013, and April 14, 2014, may have had their confidential information compromised and were advised to change their passwords, security questions and delete their browsing history.

It was heavily involved in the Latin American debt crises of the 1980s and the Asian and Russian crises of 1997-98.

IPCC,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a forum of the world's leading global warming experts, was convened by the United Nations in 1988 to draw up a report summarising climate science. [1]   IPCC in the news The hundreds of scientists who contributed to the IPCC report on climate change, released in September 2013, still believed that human activities were significantly affecting global climate. Indeed, their confidence in this conclusion had risen from 90 per cent in 2007 to 95 per cent   strengthened by thousands of new studies. The report said that rising global temperatures, melting Arctic ice and rising sea levels, had become more serious over the past decade. The IPCC predicted a rise of between 26cm and 98cm in the sea level by the end of the century, depending how much greenhouse gas is added to the atmosphere. If large portions of the Antarctic ice sheet collapsed, there would be a more damaging rise but this was judged not to be likely before 2100. As the report was partly written for policy makers and provided them with the scientific basis for action to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases but did not go into political and economic issues. Scientists hoped their reports would influence international negotiations and would lead to a strong global agreement at the next climate summit scheduled for 2015 in Paris. [2]"
IPO,"IPO (initial public offering) is the first sale of a company s shares to the public, leading to a stock market listing, known as a flotation in the UK. This is done by listing the shares on a stock exchange of the company's choosing such as the London Stock Exchange. An IPO is also referred to as a public offering, this is a sale of securities to the general public, rather than directly to select institutional or large investors (as in private placement). Shares are offered to the public for various reasons including to:  help raise money for the company and to finance growth opportunities or rebalance the balance sheet broaden the company s shareholder base provide liquidity when it comes to trading shares in the company   generate publicity for the company [1]  Empirical studies show that the main reason for listing is the creation of paper money to finance acquisitions. At the same time, a listing carries a number of costs including the obligation to produce financial statements, adopt corporate governance codes and pay dividends when required. Quoted companies need to have investor recognition and they are also subject to shareholder monitoring. Finally, there is a possibility of a change of control. The most debated costs of IPOs relate to the issuance costs which appear to be high (about 11% of the proceeds), underpricing (the fact that the first day trading price is in general higher than the offer price), and the post-IPO stock price performance which, on average, is negative. Given their relatively high level of risk, ipos should normally generate positive returns. A number of theories are provided to explain this puzzle. These include signalling as IPOs suffer from high information asymmetries, agency conflicts, market sentiment, investment banks, short sellers, sales by major shareholders/ lockup expiry, and fundamental difficulties in valuing young and high growth companies. [2] An offering can also include new shares, as in an IPO, or previously issued stock, as in a secondary offering. In a flotation, shares are issued in the primary market, this is where new securities are issued and sold directly by the issuer to investors. Any trading after that takes place on the secondary market  - where something is traded after having initially been sold (on the primary market) by the original owner or issuer. A company will need to hire lawyers and an investment bank when making plans to go public. Preparation includes an underwriting process by a syndicate made up of a group of investment banks. The bank will help value the shares, prepare a prospectus containing information about the company and help generate some interest about the shares among investors.

Inactive Account Manager in the news In June 2013 an FT writer pointed out that the law in most of the western world had yet to catch up with ownership of digital assets. A recent case involving Apple, for example, had caused a stir when it transpired that downloads bought from the company's iTunes service could not be transferred to loved ones after death. In October 2013 a report looked at the growing provision of digital estate planning to manage online activities after your death. Companies such as Cirrus Legacy would deal with all digital life including Google, Twitter and online banking passwords after a person is deceased.

International Financial Reporting Standards  IFRS,"International financial reporting standards (IFRS) represent a set of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) used by companies to prepare financial statements, a critical source of information published annually, at a minimum, and useful to various stakeholders (shareholders, debtors, clients, employees and governments) in understanding a company's financial performance and management s stewardship of the company s resources. Developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), these are a set of accounting rules followed by, or being adopted by, more than 100 countries.  All member states of the EU are required to use IFRS as adopted by the EU for listed companies since 2005. All other major economies have initiated a process to consider convergence or adoption of IFRS in the near future, even the United States (US GAAP as developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) - being the other most important set of financial reporting standards) where cross-listed firms on the US stock markets have been permitted to file statements prepared under IFRS since 2007.  With the increasing globalisation of financial markets and of companies, the use of a single set of financial reporting standards across countries is viewed as having increased the comparability of financial statements across borders. It also reduces the cost of preparing the consolidated financial statements of groups made up of companies conducting business all around the world.  Financial reporting standards have been in the spotlight since the banking crisis, more specifically those requiring the measurement of financial assets and liabilities at fair value. In September 2009, G20 leaders in Pittsburgh asked the accounting standard setters IASB and, its US counterpart, the FASB  to work towards a single set of high quality global accounting standards by June 2011. Convergence, however, is proving challenging and is likely to be pushed back. [1] Initially, IFRS begun as an academic project aimed at creating a single set of global standards, their actual use was kick-started by the European Union. [2] An EU regulation requires listed companies in Europe to adhere to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) from financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2005 when preparing their consolidated accounts. In implementing this in UK legislation the Government has not yet made the use of IFRS compulsory for any further categories of accounts, but the legislation permits all companies to use them for individual and consolidated accounts if they wish. Changes have been made to UK tax legislation to accommodate these new rules for tax purposes.

Islamic corporate social responsibility (CSR),"Sharia compliancy requires both the form and substance of Islamic finance to be fulfilled.  Therefore, it is imperative upon Islamic financial institutions and banks to evaluate their financing in terms of their social contributions as well as, say, the prohibition of interest.  While social responsibility and contributions can be voluntary for conventional financial institutions and corporations, it is a religious requirement for Islamically defined financial institutions and corporations. This is due to the fact that Islamic institutions are perceived to be an essential part of the larger environment and therefore should also contribute to the needs of the larger environment, as Islamic moral economy requires horizontal and vertical equality and growth in harmony with all the stakeholders, and also aims to remove all the barriers in front of the development path of all the stakeholders including individuals, society and natural environment. As part of this ethical economic paradigm, Islamic banks and financial institutions are expected to operate within such an objective function and framework to establish the perfect balance between financial operations and social objectives (as a morally identified objective function). Empirical studies so far, however, indicate that Islamic banks have not been fulfilling their social responsibilities. [1] "
Islamic exchange traded funds,"Shariah compliant exchange traded funds (ETFs) have emerged alongside the rapid growth of Islamic finance generally. Islamic ETFs seek to provide investment opportunities beyond the existing pool of investment, for both Muslim and ethical investors. While there has been unprecedented growth of the conventional ETFs market, Shariah compliant ETFs found their rightful place only in February 2006 when the Dow Jones Islamic Market (DJIM) Turkey ETF was listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange to track the performance of the DJIM Turkey Index. iShares, one of the dominant forces in global ETFs, launched three Islamic funds in December 2007 on the London Stock Exchange amid an increasing shift by ETF providers to offer alternative investment products. The three funds were primarily aimed at European investors with share classes in sterling and US dollars. Islamic ETFs and conventional ETFs share common characteristics. The main difference between a conventional ETF and Islamic ETF is the benchmark index that the Islamic ETF tracks. An Islamic ETF only tracks an Islamic benchmark index where the index constituents are comprised of companies which are Shariah-compliant. In addition, an Islamic ETF is managed under the Shariah principle and guidelines, and overseen by an appointed Shariah committee. The Shariah committee conducts regular reviews and audits on the Islamic ETF to ensure strict compliance with the Shariah principles and practices In a study conducted by Nafis Alam (the author of this definition) in 2013 using a sample of conventional and Islamic ETFs listed in UK by iShares for the period of 2008-2011, it was found that Islamic ETFs can beat both conventional ETFs and their selected benchmark index based on risk-adjusted performance measures. Additionally there was also evidence that a portfolio of Islamic ETFs showed less variability and was hence less risky than a portfolio invested in their conventional counterparts. Examples of Islamic ETF providers include Deutsche Bank s db-X trackers and BlackRock s iShares who both offer exposure to world, US, European, Japanese and emerging market equities.[1] Reference Alam, N. (2013)  A comparative performance analysis of conventional and Islamic exchange-traded funds , Journal of Asset Management, 14(1), 27 36."
Islamic finance,"The main principle of Islamic finance is its adherence to interest or riba-free financial transactions, while other principles are: prohibition of fixed return, profit-and-loss sharing and hence risk sharing, participatory financing; prohibition of gharar (uncertainty), speculation and gambling; money not having any inherent value in itself; and also equity-based financing. Within these principles, Islamic financial contracts are designed to facilitate financing according to Islamic norms. The contracts include: murabaha (mark up), mudaraba (venture capital type participatory financing), musharaka (participatory financing), ijarah (leasing), salam (forward financing transaction), istisna (financing for commissioned or pre-ordered production), and sukuk (asset based Islamic bonds). Islamic banks and financial institutions have developed other hybrid financial contracts based on these traditional modes. Islamic finance emerged in the early 1960s with the objective of developing and providing alternative financial contracts in conformity with Sharia principles as necessitated by Islam. Previously, various Islamic modes of financing were used in different parts of the Muslim world but the institutionalisation of Islamic finance in the form of banks and financial institutions became possible with the establishment of the first Islamic social bank, Mit Ghamr Islamic Bank in Egypt in 1963, and the first Islamic commercial bank, Dubai Islamic Bank in 1975. [1] "
Islamic index,"Using indices for guiding operations that relate to real transactions is permissible according to Sharia law.  It is permissible to use indices to determine the magnitude of a certain market or to judge the performance of certain fund managers or estimate the performance and systematic risks of a portfolio of financial papers.  It is also permissible to link periodical adjustments of salaries or wages to changes in the level of prices.  It is permissible to correlate the remuneration package of a fund s manager, mudarib s bonus, variable rent in an ijarah contract and a deferred settlement of a donation to a charitable body with a particular index.  However, trading in indices or making payment or receipt of money based on the index changes without buying or selling the real assets that the index represents, is prohibited by Shariah as it is considered a form of gambling. On the same basis, it is prohibited to conclude or deal with option contracts that are based on indices or on the index contract multiplier as these transactions deal with wills and intentions rather than real commodities. In developing an Islamic index, Sharia compliance must be adhered to in its components and a Sharia supervisory board must be appointed to conduct periodical reviews and reporting. [1]  [2] [3]"
Islamic microfinance,"Microfinance has become a critical tool in tackling poverty and aiding development through building the capacity for poor people to enjoy greater self-sufficiency and sustainability by granting them access to financial services. These are the aims of Islamic moral economy as well - serving social interest along with individual interest. Islamic microfinance is a new area within Islamic finance, whereby Islamic banks provide financing to financially excluded individuals. Islamic microfinance fits into the asset-based economic paradigm and equity objective of Islamic moral economy as well as fulfilling all other social expectations.  Thus, there is a compability and complementarity between the objectives and operational mechanism of microfinance and of Islamic finance.  However, other than a few exceptions, Islamic banks have shunned away from microfinance.  On the other hand, Indonesian and Bangladeshi cases can be considered as success stories in Islamic microfinance. [1]"

JOBS act,"The JOBS Act, signed by Barack Obama, US president, in April 2012, stands for Jumpstarting our Business Startups. This bipartisan bill reflects the consensus in Washington that entrepreneurs generate a disproportionate share of new jobs in our economy and policymakers should do more to support them. However, there is a disagreement over what policies work best. Most economists believe that 'setting the table' for an entrepreneurial economy involves a strong education system with a focus on science and technology, a sensible immigration policy that attracts and retains talented individuals, good protection of intellectual property, the presence of venture capital markets, and cultivating an environment that supports risk-taking and does not punish failure. Harvard economist Josh Lerner has pointed out that Singapore and Israel are doing excellent jobs in this regard. Politicians disagree on whether the focus should be on less regulation and lower taxes or on greater investments in human capital, scientific research, and infrastructure. The JOBS Act aims to increase access to capital by liberalising the rules around crowdfunding, providing relief to young companies from certain regulations, and expanding the pool of investors by changing the rules around general solicitation. Critics worry that these changes may have a downside in terms of weakening investor protections and allowing fly by the night operations to prey on inexperienced investors. [1]"

K2,"There are different types of tax avoidance schemes, such as K2 - the Jersey-based tax scheme. This is where an individual resigns from his/ her job in the UK and becomes an employee of an offshore company such as K2.  [1] The individual receives a minimal salary from that company. K2 seconds (or hires out) the employee to his/ her original employer, and the original employer pays a fee to K2. The offshore company, via an employee benefits trust it sets up, lends this money to the individual. [2] So the individual take part of their income in the form of a loan and pays a lower amount of tax on the minimal income and not the loan.

Kanjorski Amendment,"This is a provision of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act of 2010 that gives U.S. federal regulators the power to break up or otherwise constrain the activities of large financial institutions - if such firms pose a  grave risk  to the system.Named after Democratic congressman Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania, chairman of the Capital Markets Subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee, this part of the legislation represents a major change in the rights and responsibilities of regulators.  There are potential parallels with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 - creating the legal basis for preemptive action against overly powerful big business.It remains to be seen if regulators will use the powers thus granted, for example against firms that are judged otherwise ""too big to fail.""  But, as Mr. Kanjorski emphasised,  If just one regulator uses these extraordinary powers [to break up too big to fail banks] just once, it will send a powerful message,  that would  significantly reform how all financial services firms behave forever more. The power to decide on whether to use the Kanjorski Amendment rests with the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). [1] Financial Times definitionThis would allow regulators to break up even healthy financial companies, a move that is worrying leading US institutions.The amendment would cover ""insurance companies, banks, hedge funds, whoever may be causing systemic risk"", said Mr Kanjorski. ""Most of us yearn for the day when the phrase 'too big to fail' is no longer a part of our vocabulary. Through responsible action advocated in this amendment, we can make that a reality."" Large financial institutions had lobbied for the amendment to be withdrawn or modified, complaining that it would harm US competitiveness. Administration officials had rejected incorporating bank break-ups into regulatory reform, as a return to the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which forced a separation of commercial and investment banking, would not prevent a repeat of the financial crisis.

Kyoto protocol,"It is an international treaty, brokered by the United Nations, which binds developed nations to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases.Signed in 1997, the Kyoto protocol did not come into force until 2005. The protocol was an addition to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which had pledged the world to try to avoid dangerous climate change but did not set out how this was to be achieved.At Kyoto, developed nations agreed to cut their emissions of six greenhouse gases by an average of 5 per cent overall, compared with 1990 levels, in what was termed the first commitment period, which was to end in 2012. Developing countries were not asked to take on any emissions targets.Ex-Soviet bloc countries were also given targets, but in effect these had already been achieved   because the baseline was set for 1990, before the collapse of communist industry.But, although the protocol was signed by the US, it was never ratified by the US Congress. The Clinton administration believed it could gather together the necessary support in Congress, but quickly realised that this would be impossible. The protocol was never voted upon.As a result, the world s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and biggest economy was left out of the emissions-cutting agreement. When George W Bush took on the presidency in 2001, he rejected ratifying the treaty during his term of office.This was one major factor ensuring that the protocol could not come into effect   for the agreement to be operational, countries making up at least 55 per cent of the world s total greenhouse gas emissions had to ratify it. The European Union, Japan, Canada and other developed countries agreed, but the absence of the US made it hard for this to be reached.Then, late in 2004, after holding out for seven years, the Russian government finally agreed to ratify the protocol, which meant the threshold had been reached and Kyoto could come into effect. Russia is thought to have been persuaded by a promise from the EU to support its bid for membership of the World Trade Organisation.The move rescued the Kyoto protocol from the scrapheap of history. Developed countries were bound to begin cutting their emissions. But this task was now much harder than it had looked in 1997, because in the intervening years - as the protocol seemed unlikely ever to come into force - most countries had failed to take much action to curb their greenhouse gas output. And now they had only seven years to make the necessary cuts.The European Union   which had fought hard to keep the Kyoto protocol alive   is on track to meet its targets, but most developed countries are far adrift of theirs.

Libid,London interbank bid rate. See Libor.
Libor,"Libor stands for London interbank offered rate. The interest rate at which banks offer to lend funds (wholesale money) to one another in the international interbank market. [1] Libor is a key benchmark rate that reflects how much it costs banks to borrow from each other. It is the reference rate for about $350tn of financial products, ranging from interest rate swaps and corporate loans to credit cards, mortgages and savings accounts. Small daily moves up and down in the Libor rate can cause derivatives traders to lose or make money. Since most mortgage and credit card rates are not calculated daily, ordinary people are more likely to be affected if there is a concerted effort to push the rate in a particular direction for a long period of time. [2] A bank wishing to borrow funds (or take deposits) from another bank will quote the London interbank bid rate (Libid), while the London interbank mean rate (Limean) is the average of the two. However, Libor is the most frequently quoted. It is fixed on a daily basis by the main UK banks though it changes all the time as banks agree transactions involving large amounts of funds (usually in Eurodollars). As such Libor has become a key reference rate for all kinds of floating rate transactions, including the issue of floating rate notes. [3] The Libor is set every day at 11am by a variety of international banks citing wholesale short-term lending rates - and the most common rates are chosen. Precise details relating to the LIBOR setting can be found at http://www.bbalibor.com   Example of Libor in use In the syndicated loan market credits are priced at LIBOR+ rates. The higher risk of  the borrower the higher the rate. For instance, a low risk AAA borrower may pay LIBOR + 50 basis points whereas a higher risk BBB borrower will pay LIBOR + 250 basis points. [4]   Libor in the news   Libor scandal In 2012, regulators from around the world were probing alleged manipulation by big US and European banks of the London interbank offered rate and other key benchmark lending rates.  By the beginning of 2013 a worldwide investigation stretching from New York to Switzerland to Tokyo had discovered widespread manipulation of benchmark interbank lending rates by traders and brokers. Barclays was the first bank to settle with regulators. In December 2012 the Swiss investment bank, UBS, had agreed to pay a record $1.5bn to US, UK and Swiss authorities to settle allegations of ""pervasive"" and ""epic"" efforts to manipulate Libor. In September 2013, ICAP agreed to pay  55m to settle Libor claims to US and UK regulators making it the first interdealer broker to settle in the worldwide probe into Libor manipulation. UBS, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland had already paid a combined $2.4bn in penalties for the parts that they played.

London whale," The London whale was a UK-based trader called Bruno Iksil who worked for JPMorgan. He was known as the London whale among hedge funds and other traders, due to his big, and as it turned out, ill-advised position in a credit derivatives index. JP Morgan's chief executive at the time, Jamie Dimon, initially dismissed the claims   made by anonymous fund managers quoted in articles in the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg   as a ""tempest in a teapot"". But as one of the anonymous hedge fund managers commented, ""It wasn't just a giant whale, it was the size of the Atlantic Ocean"".   The London whale in the news In July 2012, JPMorgan announced losses of $5.8bn which it attributed to the London whale, who was also sometimes known as Voldemort. Iksil headed the credit desk in the London unit of JPMorgan's 400-strong chief investment office. In October 2012 the bank issued a claim in London's High Court against Javier Martin-Artajo who supervised Iksil. In January 2013 it emerged that Jes Staley, who had been head of JPMorgan's investment bank, although in a separate division to where Iksil was working, had crossed the divide to join BlueMountain Capital Management   one of the hedge funds that brought down the London whale. In September 2013, JPMorgan was hit by $920m in fines over the London whale trades. In settlements with four regulators, JPMorgan's management was found to have withheld information from its audit committee, including the fact that it had hired an outside law firm to examine ""significant control issues"" around the disclosure and valuation of credit derivatives. In October 2013, it emerged that JPMorgan had agreed to pay a $100m fine to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and accepted that the London Whale trading episode had a manipulative effect on credit derivative markets."
Lord Libor,"Lord Libor was the name allegedly given by his peers to a Briton called Colin Goodman, a former cash broker for ICAP, the UK interdealer broker. In September 2013, Mr Goodman, along with former colleagues Darrell Read and Daniel Wilkinson were charged with three criminal counts of wire fraud and conspiracy by the US Department of Justice relating to Libor manipulation.   Lord Libor in the news In September 2013, ICAP agreed to pay  55m to US and UK regulators to settle allegations that some of its employees, including Lord Libor, were the conduit by which yen Libor rates were manipulated around the world. But the DoJ also filed criminal charges alleging that Mr Goodman, at Mr Read and Mr Wilkinson's behest, altered his forecasts in line with rates that would be favourable to a then-UBS-trader's positions. The UK's Serious Fraud Office had its own investigation ongoing into Libor manipulation. The lawyer for Mr Wilkinson said the accused were in the unusual position of actually wanting the SFO to prosecute them in the UK to avoid being extradited to the US."

LulzSec,"LulzSec is an international hacking group that has claimed responsibility for infiltrating and shutting down the CIA website. It is an offshoot fo the international hacking group, Anonymous. Both became notorious in 2010 when they launched what they called the first ""cyberwar"" in retaliation for attempts to shut down the WikiLeaks website. The name LulzSec is a combination of ""lulz"", another way of writing ""lols"" or ""laugh out loud"", and security.   LulzSec in the news In April 2013 Australian Federal Police claimed to have arrested the self-proclaimed leader of LulzSec. Police said the unnamed Australian man, 24, used the online moniker ""Aushok"". His arrest came a week after an American member of LulzSec, Cody Kretsinger, was sentenced by a Los Angeles court to a year in prison. Court documents in that case revealed that Anonymous leader  Sabu , whose real name is Hector Xavier Monsegur, had provided the FBI with information on fellow hackers after pleading guilty to hacking offences. The Australian hacker has been charged with two counts of unauthorised modification of data to cause impairment and one count of unauthorised access to a restricted data system after a government website was attacked earlier this month."

MBA,"An MBA (Master of Business Administration) degree is the most widely-recognised business degree in the world and its popularity continues to grow, particularly in Asia. The origins of the MBA go back more than a century to the Ivy League universities in the US. Dartmouth College established the first graduate business school in the US in 1900   then called the Amos Tuck School of Administration and Finance. Harvard Business School launched its first postgraduate management degree in 1908. The popularity of the MBA grew in Europe 50 years later, following the establishment of Insead in Fontainebleau, near Paris, by a group of Harvard graduates. It enrolled its first MBA cohort in September 1959. London Business School opened its doors to MBA students in 1966. Today the MBA is usually seen as a post-experience degree, designed for those with some work/management experience. The full-time degree can last anything from 10 to 24 months but it is also taught in a number of other formats: executive (for working managers   EMBA); part-time; online/by distance learning. [1]   MBA in the news FT research published in January 2013 showed a dramatic reduction in the number of students enrolling on the UK's MBA programmes with enrolment down by 21 per cent from its peak in 2010. The downturn was blamed on changes to UK immigration policy which made it much harder for MBA graduates to gain work in the UK after graduation. Meanwhile leading US business schools which had relied heavily on the performance of their endowment funds were also facing difficulty due to the financial crisis. The economic downturn was also beginning to make some MBA students question the value of the qualification. At an average cost of $100,000 it represents a significant investment for those with no financial support. January 2013 research on alumni from the FT's top 100 ranked MBAs found average salaries had more than doubled three years after graduation.

MMO massively multiplayer online,"An MMO, or massively multiplayer online game, is a game that thousands of participants can play simultaneously over the internet. Some MMO games offer voice chat, in which players can wear a headset and talk to other unseen players online. In many games there is a facility for 'chat' windows, so that players can communicate by typing messages into a text field on their computers. MMO games have been shown to be quite addictive to some players who are prepared to spend significant amounts of money paying for add-ons (for example weaponry) that might help them in the game's virtual world. For some games the business model is based on a subscription that allows players access to the game. Others have a ""freemium"" model, where players can use the basic version of the game for free, but are charged for the add-ons they decide they need.   MMO in the news In July 2012, the FT interviewed the chief executive of Kixeye that makes MMO games for players on Facebook such as Backyard Monsters, Battle Pirates and War Commander. The company was so concerned about security that it had an armed security guard in reception. ""We have very passionate users, we had a couple of visitors at our old offices who turned up wanting to talk to somebody and that made us nervous,"" said Kixeye's chief executive. He recounted the story of a Chinese fan of one MMO who was killed in real life for selling a virtual sword he had borrowed. In August 2012, the FT reported that the US MMO game sector was under pressure from free-to-play, or ""freemium"" models from Asia."

Maslow's hierarchy of needs,"A theory (set of ideas) about motivation developed by Abraham Maslow, which has been used to explain the reasons why people decide to buy things or continue to work for an organization. Maslow identified five levels of human need: physiological-the need to eat, sleep etc;safety and security-the need to feel safe, have a job etc; belonging-the need to belong to a group, have friends and feel loved;self-esteem-the need to be successful in a particular job or activity and be respected by other people;self-actualization-the need to have new ideas and use your imagination to produce new things. The theory states that needs on one level must be satisfied before the next level can be reached, and only unsatisfied needs influence human behaviour. [1] "

Mifid,"The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid), launched in November 2007, is the European initiative to promote competition and enhance choice for investors across Europe. Mifid looks at so-called ""passporting"" for financial products so that they can be traded across borders. It considers transparency and best execution.    Mifid in the news In November 2012 it was reported that the review of Mifid, Europe s key legislation governing markets, has grown from a directive designed to encourage competition to a regulation looking to safeguard markets from systemic risk. It was also reported that discussion on it had been delayed. In February 2013, an influential MEP warned Europe may face a third round of legislation if the region could not soon agree its much-delayed revision of Mifid and its dealing rules for banks, brokers and high-frequency traders. In January 2014 it was reported that Europe had agreed its biggest overhaul of securities markets since the 2008 financial crisis extending its regulatory reach into off-exchange dealing, commodity speculation and the new technologies that have transformed the speed of modern trading. The revamped legislation updates the original Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid).               "

Mint economies in the news In November 2013 the FT's Beyond Brics emerging markets hub considered prospects for the Mint economies and examined where investors were actually putting their money. EPFR data showed that Mint economies had attracted $17.1bn against $141.73bn invested in Bric economies. Also in November 2013 an FT writer referred to the new Mint grouping as a means of illustrating how important Africa had become.               "
Mittelstand," Mittelstand : can be used to describe an individual organisation or a type of specialist SME.  It is essentially a family business, has a strong stakeholder commitment, and a focused product-service, usually in industrial sector niches, involvement.  It is also identified by the term  Micro-Multinational  reflecting its focused interests and extensive international reach. The term Mittelstand (strong specialist small enterprise) was coined in Germany and describes companies with 50 to 500 employees and up to  50m annual turnover (some do exceed this amount). Some Mittelstand companies have been existence in excess of 100 years. The term has come to be used to describe derivatives of the German model. More than 99 per cent of all German firms belong to the  German Mittelstand  which contributes almost 52 per cent of total economic output and in 2011 it accounted for around 37 per cent of the overall turnover of German companies. It employs approximately 60 per cent of all employees. The Mittelstand's training programmes contribute significantly towards the comparatively low level of youth unemployment. Overseas revenues have been growing for years, and stood at  186.1bn in 2010.   Almost all of Germany s SMEs are family-owned, and many are managed by their owner. Their business policies tend to be especially long-term.  Some 90 per cent of them operate in the business-to-business market and 70 per cent are based in rural areas (Economist: 2010).   Mittelstand companies focus on market niches, typically in areas such as mechanical engineering.  They have spent the past 30 years working to turn their domination of German market niches into domination of global ones; for example; K rcher   high-pressure cleaners and Koenig & Bauer, printing presses.   Compared with similar SME companies elsewhere in the world, the  German Mittelstand  is highly active in the industrial sector: almost a quarter of all employees work in this field.  It is a major supplier of capital goods in new markets all round the world.   The German Mittelstand companies have a unique corporate culture driven by family ownership. Long-term survival and intergenerational transfer dominate objectives.  Profit is expected as a result of attention paid to customers, and a focus on long-term mutual sustainability with key stakeholders, leading to an implicit  life-long  contract with the stakeholders.  Flat hierarchies and informal channels of communication implement the Mittelstand philosophy. (also see: Database German World Market Leaders 2.2.2 (01.10.2010)   World Market Leader (narrower sense)   2011 Prof. Dr. Bernd Venohr).  Structurally, their high equity ratio and a cautious approach to expansion has enabled these organisations to undertake medium-term and long-term investments, even in times of crisis.  They finance most of their investment from their own equity (54 per cent) and bank loans (29 per cent).  In 2011, 11 per cent of the investment was financed using public-sector assistance and venture capital funding.  German Mittelstand companies are some of the most innovative in Europe   54 per cent of companies brought a product or process innovation to market in the 2008-2010 period   the EU average was only 34 per cent.  Some  8.7m was invested in research and development in 2010.  Spending on R&D; rose by around 71 per cent between 2004 and 2010, compared with about 19 per cent for large companies.   Similar organisations exist elsewhere.  Japan has a number of very successful medium sized organisations   chuken kigyo   strong medium-sized firms.  Like the Mittelstand the chuken kigyo is not simply a part of the national economy, but the core of its industrial structure. It enables the country's bigger, well-known electronics firms to exist, as well as meeting foreigners' essential needs.   The chuken kigyo established itself in the 1980s on the world market as a major new actor in Japanese industry.  Such companies serve more than 70 per cent of the worldwide market in at least 30 technology sectors worth more than $1 billion apiece. Their niche areas are mostly at the high-end of electronics, engineering and materials-science.  Roper and Malshe (2013) have identified the UK s  mid-market  organisations Growth Champions (companies with an annual turnover of between  20m and  1bn) as having stronger growth than the German Mittelstand companies in recent years.   While there is a tendency to for them to emphasise short-term objectives such as cost control, they do map the strategic characteristics of the Mittelstand model: a focus on expansion, on investing in new talent and setting ambitious growth targets; re-investing in the business for R&D;, innovation, and for productivity improvement. See Groom and Connor (2013) for a detailed discussion of the report. The Mittelstand model is working well, but globalisation is forcing it to adapt. Many German companies have opened sales and service outlets and even factories abroad.  Wittenstein, a manufacturer of high-quality gears and drive systems in Baden-W rttemberg, has chosen an optimal strategy: exports make up 57 per cent of its  200m annual sales, with most going to Europe and North America, and 9 per cent to Asia.  It is also considering a possible move into China.   Despite, or perhaps because of, its caution, the Mittelstand is booming. Sales are reckoned by some to be growing at nearly 12 per cent a year. As Ren  Obermann, the boss of Deutsche Telekom, recently remarked;  this is faster than the Chinese economy .  The Mittelstand model has attraction for developed economies that lack the opportunities for offshore revenues afforded by developing manufacturing economies of scale.  The Mittelstand offers the opportunity to develop knowledge based businesses that can achieve international responses and revenues.[1]"

Obamacare,"""Obamacare"" is the word used by Republicans to deride President Barack Obama's signal achievement of his first term - reforming the US healthcare system - but it is a word that Democrats are increasingly using in an attempt to destigmatise it. In 2010, Mr Obama signed ""The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act"", as his reforms are officially known, realising a goal that had eluded generations of Democratic leaders, even if the changes did not extend as far as the president initially hoped. ExampleThe law banned insurers from refusing coverage to those with pre-existing medical conditions and also allowed dependents to remain on their parents' healthcare plans until the age of 26, two hugely popular provisions. However, to make the reforms workable, the law introduced the  individual mandate  - a requirement for almost all Americans to buy health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty. Lower income people are eligible for financial subsidies to help pay for insurance, while states have to set up ""health exchanges"" by 2013 to allow individuals and small businesses to band together and get better deals on health insurance, the same way that big companies do already. [1] Private insurers would have an incentive to participate in the exchange: the prospect of competing for millions of Americans without insurance. [2] Insurance companies had complained that they would not be able to survive if they had an influx of expensive customers, thanks to the ban on refusing to cover sick people, without the off-setting benefit of having millions of healthy patients on their books.Republicans had challenged the mandate as unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court ruled that it was not in 2012. However, it did not uphold the law in its entirety, declaring the expansion of the Medicaid health insurance plan -  for low-income and disabled Americans -  to be at odds with the Constitutional because it required states to expand coverage or lose all federal Medicaid funding.

Obamanomics,"Obamanomics is a neologism which seeks to define the economic philosophy of the Obama administration. The portmanteau has obvious historical references to ""Reaganomics"", which is commonly used to define the policies of President Reagan in the 1980s. Less obvious, however, is agreement on what Obamanomics actually means. To conservatives, the term is used negatively to describe an increasing role for the state. Democrats, meanwhile, cite health care reform and cap-and-trade as positive examples of Obamanomics. The reason why the term is difficult to define is because the Obama administration was thrust headfirst into the financial crisis and recession. Emergency measures are being confused with a new economic philosophy. [1]"

Facebook Connect was a first attempt at an interface that would allow other platforms and websites to take advantage of the user information already contained in a Facebook profile. The largest social networking company introduced its Open Graph strategy as an evolution that meaningfully connects people and things across the web. [1] ExampleIn 2010, Facebook said it was launching Open Graph with 30 partners spanning categories from books and movies to celebrities and athletes with sites such as CNN's news site and the ESPN sport site embedding its social plugins. Facebook users visiting the sites could click a ""Like"" button on stories they want to share with friends and would see pop-up windows showing friends who had also liked something. They could also see their friends' activity on the site and share comments through other plugins. Liking a movie on the IMDB film website would include that movie in the user's interests in their Facebook profile, with a link back to the original site.

An important indication of comparative value - investors are normally better off buying a stock with a low P/E ratio than one with a high ratio, as they are getting more earnings for their money. [1] A company's share price divided by the amount of profits it makes for each share in a 12-month period.

Panama plan,"A Panama plan entails using another country s currency without forming a currency union with common fiscal aims. Panama plan is a term coined by Alistair Darling, former UK chancellor and leader of the pro-union Better Together campaign, which was set up prior to the Scottish referendum on whether it should break away from the rest of the United Kingdom, to lobby against Scottish independence. Mr Darling used the phrase ""Panama plan"" in February 2014 in response to the assertion by Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister that an independent Scotland could continue to use the pound even if Westminster refused to enter a currency union. Mr Darling responded by saying that the proposal sounded like a ""Panama Plan"", requiring Scotland to generate a permanent balance of payments surplus to ensure it had enough money to pay its way, with interest rates set by ""a foreign country"". A letter writer to the FT pointed out that the phrase ""Panama plan"" could have a double meaning. The failure of an attempt to build a Scottish colony, the Darien scheme, is often cited as a precipitating factor for the 1707 Act of Union which saw Scotland's political union with England. The Darien scheme was located on the isthmus of Panama."

Pension Protection Fund PPF,"The Pension Protection Fund was set up in the UK as a result of the Pensions Act 2004. To help fund the PPF, compulsory annual levies are charged on all eligible schemes. The PPF is also responsible for the Fraud Compensation Fund which was set up to provide compensation to occupational pension schemes that suffer a loss that can be attributable to dishonesty. Members of defined benefit pension schemes in the UK are protected by the Pension Protection Fund which will pay most of the benefits to members if the employer goes bust. On buyout, however, the protection regime switches from the PPF to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Final salary members who are retired when their employer goes bust can generally expect to continue receiving 100 per cent of their pension from the PPF. Members who have not retired will have 90 per cent of their benefits protected up to a cap of about  31,000. In contrast, the FSCS will pay 90 per cent of all benefits to all members, retired and not yet retired, with no cap.    Pension Protection Fund (PPF) in the news In June 2013 it was reported that the Pension Protection Fund would take over the  543m pension liability of the UK Coal Operations, the rump of the once nationalised British Coal. The company is owned by the miners' pension scheme and the deal meant that the PPF would become the owner of two deep and six open cast mines. The pensions deal raised questions about likely losses that would be suffered by the PPF and raised the spectre of the need to increase the annual levy that the PPF charges to members."

Personhood,"The concept of personhood comes from both philosophy and law. It originally appeared as an understanding of what it means to be a person and of who is and is not a person (slaves, for example). Some academics apply this concept to organisations to represente a synthesis of a specific mindset, attitude and behaviour within the organisation. In the same way that citizenship reflects the qualities and rights of an honourable person in a community or society, personhood reflects the qualities and rights of an honourable manager in an organisation. Personhood means understanding that a manager does not work with  human resources  but with people. It means being sensitive to the complexity and the contradictions of people who have competencies and interests but also feelings, desires, passions, fears and loyalties. It also means understanding that economic incentives are important, but so is the meaning of what is done and why, as well as the sense of contribution to a greater objective. Personhood means putting effort into being fair and not necessarily taking advantage of superior information, position or power. It means acting according to Kant s categorical imperative: do that which can be elevated to a category (i.e. it would be good if everyone acted upon the same criteria, and that one could explain it transparently). Many family businesses have enormous amounts of personhood, and this is a valuable resource because personhood generates trust.[1]"

Pibs,"When is a share not a share  Answer: when it's a Permanent Interest Bearing Share (Pibs). There is a clue to the nature of Pibs in their name. ""Permanent"" capital signifies debt, which means they pay interest gross. So a ""permanent interest-bearing share"", with a fixed income, though it might seem like a share, is a bond in all but name. Pibs issuers are invariably building societies and, as the shares rank behind other forms of debt, and behind the interests of depositors, they usually offer higher yields. They are also undated, rather like irredeemable gilt-edge stocks. But some are callable, which means that the issuer has an option to redeem them at a fixed price at a specified date. [1] Permanent interest-bearing shares behave more like bonds - they are generally high risk bonds. They are shares issued by building societies to raise capital. They are also quoted on the London Stock Exchange, but like government paper, they offer a fixed coupon, but there is no guarantee that this will be paid.  [2] ViewA share that acts like a bond"

Planning Gain Supplement,"The Barker review of housing supply, Delivering stability: securing our future housing needs, included a proposal for a 'planning-gain supplement' (effectively a tax on development gains). In the 2005 Pre-Budget Report the Government announced a consultation on the introduction of a planning-gain supplement, which would be chargeable at the point a development commenced. The amount due would be based on the uplift in the value of the land at the point at which planning permission for the development had been granted.  Three further consultations were launched at the time of the 2006 Pre-Budget Report and the Government indicated that it would go ahead with the introduction of PGS if it is found to be workable.In setting out the provisional programme for the 2007/08 Parliamentary session, the Prime Minister stated that a Planning Gain Supplement Bill had only provisionally been included and would be deferred if a better alternative had been identified by the time of the 2007 Pre-Budget Report.In the 2007 Pre-Budget Report, the Government announced that a Planning Gain Supplement would no longer be introduced. In its place, the Planning Bill (since enacted as the Planning Act 2008) included legislation allowing local Planning Authorities in England to apply new planning charges to new development together with negotiated contributions for site specific matters.

QE,See quantitative easing
QE2,"Quantitative easing (QE) is the practice of expanding a central bank s balance sheet by buying long-term assets in an attempt to drive down long-term interest rates, something that it only has reason to do once short-term interest rates are already at or close to zero. In 2010, the Federal Reserve launched a new programme of quantitative easing - nicknamed QE2 - and will buy $600bn of longer-term Treasury securities by the middle of 2011.  It has done so because America s economic recovery has been a disappointment, weighed down by debts backed by houses that have fallen in value.  Households are reluctant to spend, so businesses are reluctant to invest. Since April 2010, the US private sector has struggled to create 50,000 jobs a month, that is barely enough to keep up with population growth, let alone bring down the 9.6% unemployment rate.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the output gap - the difference between what the economy could produce and what it actually did - was 6.3 per cent in the second quarter of 2010. On the other side of the ledger   inflation   the Fed s preferred price index for core personal consumption expenditures is up by only 1.5 per cent on a year ago and that compares to the Fed s objective of 2% and may fall further in the coming months. Political deadlock means that there is little chance of any further fiscal stimulus, so the Fed is the only agency in town with any hope of getting the economy going, and driving down long-term interest rates with QE2 could be its best bet. In QE2, the Fed will expand its balance sheet through purchases of long-term Treasury bonds. The Fed and its chairman, Ben Bernanke, believe that QE works by changing the balance of risks on offer to the private sector.  By buying large numbers of risk-free long-term Treasury bonds, they think they can force the public either to pay more for similar bonds or to invest in something else.  That something else might be a loan to a company, which would in turn use the funds to invest and so boost the economy Market reactions, since Bernanke gave a big speech to central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on August 27, have been an encouraging sign that QE2 may work.  The spread between yields on regular 10-year Treasury bonds and on inflation-protected 10-year Treasury bonds which gives a sign on how much inflation the market expects have risen from 1.6 to 2.1 percentage points.  In addition, the trade-weighted dollar has fallen by more than 4 per cent.  These moves show markets believe QE2 is capable of moving asset prices, at least.  Although, there is still a question about how much that can spur the economy. For a hard core of hawks on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the risks of failure with QE2 are so grave that the policy ought to be ruled out altogether.  QE2 is often described as  printing money , although a better description is ""forcing loans on people who are reluctant to spend them"", and the obvious risk is that the Fed could go too far and thus ignite inflation. But the more serious risk is that by pushing down yields on long-term US Treasury bonds - the world s benchmark interest rate - the Fed will be forcing investors into other assets, from foreign currencies to equities. That may have unintended consequences, not least the risk of creating asset price bubbles, which may end unhappily.

QE3,"The Fed announced in 2012 that it would begin a new programme of unlimited purchases of mortgage-backed securities   nicknamed QE3 or quantitative easing three. [1] The first round of QE came during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. The second round (QE2), preceded by three months of fevered speculation, came in November 2010. [2] Unlike previous programmes, the Fed s third round of quantitative easing does not have a defined limit and will continue until the labour market improves. Combined with its purchases of long-dated Treasuries under  Operation Twist , this will see the Fed buying a total of $85bn of assets a month for the rest of 2012, similar to its QE2 programme in 2010. [3] Operation Twist   the Fed s programme of switching its short-term assets into longer-dated Treasuries in a QE-like effort to drive down long-term interest rates   should be complete by the end of 2012. [4] ExampleIn 2012, Guido Mantega, Brazil s finance minister, has warned that the US Federal Reserve s  protectionist  move to roll out more quantitative easing will reignite the currency wars with potentially drastic consequences for the rest of the world. The Fed s QE3 programme would  only have a marginal benefit [in the US] as there is already no lack of liquidity . . . and that liquidity is not going into production,  explained Mr Mantega. He said it was instead depressing the dollar and aimed at boosting US exports. Mr Mantega coined the phrase currency wars two years ago when the second round of QE by the Fed pushed a wall of money abroad, leading to a punishing appreciation of many emerging market currencies, especially Brazil s.

QFII,"The qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII) programme started in 2002 and allowed licensed foreign institutional investors a quota to buy Chinese-listed A-shares (previously only available to domestic investors). The scheme attracted criticism for allowing only very few foreign entities to participate. There were complaints about the length of time they had to wait between applying for a quota and being granted one.    QFII in the news In April 2012 the net quota for QFII investment was raised from $30bn to $80bn. In December 2012, China raised foreign investment limits under the QFII scheme. The overall net quota for the QFII programme was to remain at its current $80bn, but institutions could now apply to invest over $1bn if they chose. The new regulations also relax restrictions on the ability of funds to remit principal and income from investments, but made no further clarifications as to how China will tax QFII profits, an area of enduring uncertainty for QFII investors."
QII (qualified institutional investor),"In certain countries where financial markets are not fully liberalised, an institutional investor authorised by the local financial regulator to participate in certain types of transaction as long as specific criteria are met. Depending on local regulations and the investment schemes or markets involved, different conditions may be imposed on domestic and foreign institutions (sometimes called qualified domestic institutional investor or QDII, and qualified foreign institutional investor or QFII)."

R&D; tax credits,"Generally, enhanced deductions on research and development (R&D;) are available in respect of qualifying revenue R&D; expenditure. Companies can claim an enhanced deduction at a rate that will depend on whether they are large or small and medium sized companies (SMEs). SMEs can claim a deduction from taxable profits of 230 percent of their qualifying R&D; expenditure and. if loss making, will be able to claim a cash payment in return for forfeiting a proportion of their losses. Large companies may claim a deduction of 130 percent of their qualifying revenue R&D; expenditure. Only certain expenses, e.g. a company s own staff costs, are eligible. R and D tax credits for large companies will continue as an alternative to the RDEC regime, until 31 March 2016, when the large company regime will end. There is a separate regime for companies of all sizes where the R&D; expenditure is capital in nature for tax purposes. This allows a 100 percent deduction as expenditure is incurred but does not provide any enhancement to amounts. [1]"
R-squared,"In statistics, R-squared (R2), or the coefficient of determination, is a widely used measure of a model (regression) performance against known observations. It is used in the asset management industry to measure the relationship between a portfolio and its benchmark. In the asset management world it is expressed as a percentage. R-squared does not, however, measure the performance of a portfolio, but it does measure the correlation of the portfolio's returns to the benchmark's returns. If an investor is seeking a portfolio or a fund that moves like the benchmark it would be wise to invest in a product or strategy with a high R-squared number.  A range of 70-100 per cent would indicate a high correlation between the portfolio's returns and the benchmark's returns. A score of between 1 per cent and 40 per cent would show a low correlation between the portfolio's returns and the benchmark's returns. Index funds and ETFs are likely to have an R-squared close to 100. R-squared is used to determine whether returns are generated by beta performance or alpha performance.    R-squared in the news In March 2010 an FT columnist wrote about the true costs of investment funds, arguing that total expense ratios do not include the impact of direct and indirect transaction costs. In other words, the true cost of owning an actively managed fund can be higher than its TER suggests. One method of deriving an idea of true cost of a fund is to consider a fund's TER, its R-squared and the reported alpha (outperformance of its benchmark). The ""true cost"" can be derived if you take the difference in cost between the TER of any given fund and that of an appropriate low-cost index fund and apply this to the small proportion of the fund that the R-squared analysis suggests is the only genuinely actively managed component of the portfolio. The calculation reveals some spectacular overcharging."

RQFII,"RQFII is the renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor scheme. Launched in December 2011 it allowed a small number Chinese financial firms to establish renminbi-denominated funds in Hong Kong for investment in the mainland. The aim being to allow overseas investors to use offshore renminbi deposits to invest in mainland securities markets  The China Securities Regulatory Commission initially set the quota at 20bn renminbi divided between a numer of companies, all of which were subsidiaries of mainland asset managers. The quota was later raised to 70bn renminbi and by November 2012 had been further raised to 270bn. Restrictions were also imposed on investment class from the outset. The CSRC determined that 80 per cent of the quota should be invested in mainland fixed-income markets (including the inter-bank bond and exchange traded bond market) while 20 per cent was to be allowed to enter the stock markets. The fear was that large amounts of money entering mainland stock markets would cause volatility.   RQFII in the news In September 2012 a surge of enthusiasm was reported for RQFII funds following a rally in China's bond market. In March 2013 the RQFII scheme was further widened. Previously, the programme was only open to Hong Kong subsidiaries of Chinese companies, meaning just a handful of companies could apply for investment quotas. From March 2013 this was widened to include international banks and asset managers with a presence in Hong Kong, paving the way for a host of new products and fund launches."

Red Queen,"The terms Red Queen race or Red Queen hypothesis comes from Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass. The Red Queen is a character whom Alice meets who looks like a queen from a chess board. In the book there is a scene where the two characters are running but when they stop for a rest Alice finds they are in the same place they had been when they started. Well, in our country,"" said Alice, still panting a little, ""you'd generally get to somewhere else   if you run very fast for a long time, as we've been doing."" ""A slow sort of country "" said the Queen. ""Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that ""  The term Red Queen has since been used in scientific circles to describe an evolutionary concept, namely that evolutionary change in one species could prompt change in another co-dependent species if it wants to avoid extinction. In other words the species have to run (evolve)  in order to remain in the same place (simply avoid extinction). The word is also used in general parlance to describe any situation where entities have to make huge efforts to remain in the same state.   Red Queen in the news In April 2010, an FT columnist wrote of the dangers facing the world's financial system. The columnist referred to a speech made by Andrew Haldane of the Bank of England in which he bemoaned a progressive rise in banking risk and an accompanying widening and deepening of the state safety net. This, said the columnist, was a Red Queen's race with the system running to stand still with governments racing to to make finance safer and bankers creating more risk. In November 2013, David Willetts, the UK minister for universities and science wrote in the FT to defend the university degree, despite evidence that its earning power had been eroded. The article drew a number of comments including one by Jonathan Davies who wrote that young people were experiencing the ""Red Queen Effect"" in that they were having to run ever harder just to stay in the same place. Mr Davies pointed out that young people were having to stay in education and accrue huge debts just to get the same jobs that would have been available with school leaving qualifications a few decades earlier."

Rule 2,"There is one vital feature of the UK takeover rules that makes them among the most stringent in the world. It is known as Rule 2 and it governs the timing of announcements relating to offers for a company. Unlike the US, where companies do not have to comment on speculation or rumour, in the UK targets can be forced to spill the beans. Reform in 2011 tightened Rule 2 further so that any rumour about a possible bid for a company or big swings in its share price, can force the target to reveal all the parties it is in talks with. The revelation that it is in talks about a possible takeover automatically starts the clock ticking on the 28-day  put up or shut up  deadline for a firm offer to be made. ExampleThat new dynamic means an inadvertent leak could scupper takeover plans. Either media-shy corporates get cold feet or bidders cannot get financing ready in time. If a bidder pulls out of talks, they are restricted from restarting them for up to six months. One of the reforms tightened Rule 2 further so that even if the talks are never made public, this restriction still applies. [1] ViewUK takeover rules among most stringent"

Sharia board,"A Sharia supervisory Board or Sharia committee is set up by a financial institution (usually an Islamic bank or an Islamic insurance company) to advise and certify certain financial products. Originally, the Sharia board was not compulsory in Islamic finance but it became so over time because of the sophistication of financial products. The benefits are twofold: - there is now formal confirmation on whether or not these products are fully Islamic - and having a Sharia Board adds credibility to Islamic financial institutions. Finally, some Islamic countries have made it compulsory for an Islamic financial institution to have a Sharia board. Sharia scholars have created a market of their own because the financial institutions are free to choose the Sharia scholars who will be part of the board. Because there are not many scholars qualified in both Sharia law and finance, there is an unusual concentration of positions in very few hands. The three most sought after scholars are part of 241 Islamic financial institutions and 27 regulating bodies. This raises questions of confidentiality of conflict of interest and of whether scholars are part of competing institutions or if they have to regulate the institution of which they are a part.

Sharpe,See Sharpe ratio
Sharpe ratio,"A way of measuring the historical risk-adjusted return on an investment. It is the average previous return minus the risk-free return, divided by the standard deviation (a measure of risk that looks at the diversion of actual returns from expected returns). [1]  Measuring the historical performance of investment managers, such as mutual fund and hedge fund managers, has always been a challenge. The lack of performance consistency and repeatability (that is repeating past good performance), track record, and adjustment for risk, are the frequently cited problems.  Nevertheless, academia and the industry have attempted to surmount these problems by coming up with succinct, risk-adjusted measures so as to encapsulate the performance of an investment manager using metrics. One of the metrics is the Sharpe ratio which is a measure of the excess return per unit of risk. The risk-adjusted measure is the adjustment of investment performance for the risk taken by the investment manager. This is used to measure the historical performance of absolute return funds. To calculate this you take the after-fee investment performance of the absolute return fund minus the  riskless  rate such as the Libor.  Then, you take the result and divide it by the standard deviation of returns.  The higher the number, the better the result. Example For instance, a hedge fund managed to underperform the Libor by minus 4 per cent per annum over the past three years, with a corresponding standard deviation of 8 per cent per annum. The Sharpe ratio of the fund is   0.5.   However, as the Financial Times  - in the ""Lessons from past performance"" article - astutely points out, these ratios are all based on the manager s historical performance, and past performance is no guide to future performance. With that caveat in mind, many fund rating companies, such as Morningstar and Lipper, provide comprehensive fund management rankings, commentaries, risk-adjusted performance and the suitability of various funds in their reports and on their websites.

The Sharpe ratio of the fund is   0.5.   However, as the Financial Times  - in the ""Lessons from past performance"" article - astutely points out, these ratios are all based on the manager s historical performance, and past performance is no guide to future performance. With that caveat in mind, many fund rating companies, such as Morningstar and Lipper, provide comprehensive fund management rankings, commentaries, risk-adjusted performance and the suitability of various funds in their reports and on their websites.

Solvency II,"Solvency II is a fundamental review of the capital adequacy regime for the European insurance industry. It aims to establish a revised set of EU-wide capital requirements and risk management standards that will replace the current solvency requirements. Solvency I was a minimum harmonisation directive introduced in the early 1970s. It allowed for diffferences to emerge in the way that insurance regulation was applied across Europe, leading to different regimes. It was also primarily focused on the capital adequacy for insurers and did not include requirements for risk management and governance within firms. Solvency II aims to achieve consistency across Europe and includes the following key ideas: * market consistent balance sheets * risk-based capital * own risk and solvency assessment * senior management accountability * supervisory assessment[1]    Solvency II in the news In April 2013 the hazards of applying a Solvency II regime on pension schemes, many of which are backed by insurance companies, were highlighted in a report in the FT which found that many would have huge deficits under the new calculations."

Spitzenkandidat,"Spitzenkandidat literally means top candidate or party list leader.

The Spitzenkandidat would then become the party's choice for the EU's most high-profile job   European Commission president. The PES has argued that picking a Spitzenkandidat would democratise the process of selecting the commission president. But the concept only gained momentum in December 2013 when the centre right European People's Party decided to do the same, despite the objections of some of its high profile leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.    Spitzenkandidat in the news In December 2013, a report in The Economist discussed the many challenges posed by the EU electoral system and the fact that all the big jobs would be up for grabs in 2014. One of the challenges, it said, was the pressure to make the electoral process more political and to campaign around Spitzenkanditaten.

TPP Trans Pacific Parnership Agreement,"The Trans Pacific Partnership agreement had humble beginnings. It was initially a trade pact envisaged by Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore, but the TPP was transformed in 2008 when the US expressed its interest. Since then, the TPP has expanded to 12 members, bringing in Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam. Most significantly, in 2013, Japan   often considered a free-trade laggard   surprised many by entering the talks. Its entry brings a critical mass to a deal that, if completed, would cover countries that account for two-fifths of global output and one-third of international trade.[1] It is called a partnership because the negotiation goes beyond lowering traditional trade barriers, such as tariffs and quotas, and is expected to include rules on regulatory policies (such as competition law). These 12 nations are also expected to agree upon rules on the conduct of state-owned enterprises, which sometimes receive subsidies from governments or give subsidies to others--both of which can allow for undercutting of rivals. The American government likes to call this partnership a ""gold standard"" agreement because they regard it as the most comprehensive trade deal ever negotiated, more far reaching that the WTO accords.""[2]                        TPP in the news In February 2014 an FT reporter wrote that trade talks had stalled on a US-Japan stand-off after the two biggest powers, the US and Japan, failed to agree on allowing easier access to each other's markets. In April 2014 the US criticised Japan's stance on the TPP. At a congressional hearing the US trade representative, said he had told Japan that it was not living up to its commitment to help create a  high-standard, ambitious, comprehensive  agreement."

Ted spread,"This is the difference between the interest rate at which the US Government is able to borrow on a three month period (T-bill) and the rate at which banks lend to each other money on a three month period (measured by the Libor). Since, arguably, the risk of a bank defaulting is slightly higher than that of the US government defaulting, the Ted spread measures the estimated risks that banks pose on each other.  The higher the perceived risk that one or several banks may have liquidity or solvency problems, the higher the rate you will ask from your loans to other banks compared to your loans to the government. Consequently, the Ted spread is a great indicator of interbank credit risk and the perceived health of the banking system. [1] ExampleIn 2008, the Ted spread peaked at 450 basis points after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In 2010, the Ted spread has returned slowly to its long-term average of 30 basis points, hitting a low of 11 basis points in March, as confidence returned. But as the Greek debt crisis escalated into widespread fears about the health of the eurozone, the Ted spread started to rise again, moving above 45 basis points by mid-June. [2] When the Ted spread goes up, the interbank default risk is considered to be higher and when the spread decreases, the interbank default risk is considered to be lower. When there is a downturn in the economy, banks suspect that some banks may encounter problems.  However, they do not know which banks, so they restrict interbank lending, resulting in higher Ted spreads and lower liquidity in the interbank market, which ultimately produces lower credit availability for consumers and corporates.

The Fragile Five Biits,"The Fragile Five, or the Fragile Five Biits, is a term coined in 2013 to refer to Brazil, Indonesia, India, Turkey and South Africa. There was some fear at the time that the difficulties being experienced by these five emerging economies, especially with their currencies, could trigger a generalised crisis in the same way that Thailand triggered a global crisis in 1997.   Fragile Five in the news In August 2013 an FT writer concluded that although the Fragile Five collectively accounted for about 7 per cent of global GDP, exposure of other countries was geographically limited. Latin American countries were exposed to Brazil and countries of the Gulf were exposed to India and Turkey, but unless speculators lost their cool there was no need for widespread contagion. In October 2013, a blogger asked if the Fragile Five were really that fragile.

Tips (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities),"Tips, or Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, are bonds backed by the US Treasury which track inflation. They are seen as low risk because of the low risk of default by the US government. They are normally, 5-year, 10-year and 30-year bonds, whose principal is adjusted on a regular basis to reflect changes in the consumer price index (CPI). At maturity, the securities can be redeemed at face value or at their inflation-adjusted value, whichever is greater.   Tips in the news In February 2013 it was reported that enthusiasm for investing in Tips had soured. An index of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities had recorded a total return of minus 1 per cent in 2013, outpacing the 0.81 per cent slide seen for the cash or nominal Treasury index, according to Barclays.  The slide was attributed to their strong performance in the previous few years which had pulled their real or inflation-protected yield   which moves inversely to price   below zero, entering negative territory. Much of the capital appreciation for Tips up to 2013 had been a function of bond prices rising as their yield has turned negative. Michael Pond, head of global inflation-linked research at Barclays, told the FT that Tips might struggle in 2013 after several strong years of performance. He added:  If bond yields go up, Tips can record a negative return. Tips funds may rally as inflation rises, but ultimately lose out if real rates rise amid a wider bond market sell-off. "
Tobin tax,"The  Tobin tax  was originally proposed in the early 1970s by James Tobin, an influential American macroeconomist and recipient of the Nobel prize for economics. His idea was prompted by the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, which replaced an arrangement of fixed exchange rates ultimately based on the US dollar s peg to gold with a period of volatile floating exchange rates.  He wanted to discourage short-term currency speculation, which makes it difficult for countries to implement independent monetary policies by moving money quickly back and forth between countries with different interest rates. [1] As described by Tobin, the tax involves applying a small charge   of as little or less than 0.1 per cent   on foreign currency transactions to protect countries from exchange-rate volatility caused by short-term currency speculation. Before Tobin died in 2002, he changed his thinking, arguing that the tax was unworkable because the liberalisation of the capital markets made it much trickier to undertake.

Tobin's q ratio,"Tobin's q, or the q ratio, is the ratio of the market value of a company's assets (as measured by the market value of its outstanding stock and debt) divided by the replacement cost of the company's assets (book value).   Calculating a q ratio    Q ratios can also be used for calculating a stock market valuation. In this case the aggregate of the stock market values for companies in a given stock market or index is divided by the aggregate of the replacement value of those companies' assets.   q ratio in the news In September 2013 an FT columnist examined two competing ways of analysing stock market valuations   the q ratio and Cape. Although the two methods used very different calculations, both pointed to the fact that the US stock market was significantly overvalued leading some to question the accuracy of both methods."

Triffin dilemma,"This is where incessant foreign demand for a reserve currency would  force its issuing country to run persistent current account deficits. [1] A reserve currency is a foreign currency that is traditionally held  in countries  official reserves because of its global importance as a medium of  exchange and its inherent stability. The reserve-currency country enjoys the consumption benefit of running a trade deficit, while the rest of the world benefits from the additional liquidity, which helps facilitate trade. The cost comes from the declining value and credibility of any currency which runs a persistent trade deficit - eventually leading to a reluctance of creditors to hold the reserve currency. [2] ExampleAs Francis Warnock (professor at the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business) points out in a paper for the Council On Foreign Relations, in 2010, the US confronted a dilemma first identified in 1960 by the Belgian-born Yale economist Robert Triffin. To supply the world s risk-free asset, the country at the heart of the international monetary system has to run a current account deficit. In doing so, it becomes more indebted to foreigners until the risk-free asset ceases to be risk-free. [3] ViewCurrencies: Strength in reserve"

Tulip mania,"Tulip mania is the name given in English to a period in Dutch history in which there was intense speculation on the price of tulip bulbs. Tulips had grown in popularity during the early 1600s following their original introduction to The Netherlands from Turkey. The market was so vibrant that tulip traders would sign contracts to buy tulip bulbs at the end of the season in which they bloom. By 1634 speculators were beginning to enter the market and prices were driven even higher. In 1636 a futures market was created where the contracts to buy tulips could be bought and sold. Tulip mania peaked in 1636-1637 when the price on the contract to buy one rare bulb was reported to be over 5,000 guilders   the cost of a luxurious house in Amsterdam and many times the 300 guilders annual salary of a skilled craftsman. Prices collapsed in February 1637 leaving some investors bankrupt.  Tulip mania is now used to refer to any period in which there is irrational speculation which appears to inflate a bubble.   Tulip mania in the news In January 2014 a professor of economics writing in the FT said the craze for Bitcoin was equivalent to Tulip mania. The mania, he wrote, is not over, but he said the longer it lasted the more investors were likely to get burnt. The association of tulips and Bitcoins was first made by Dutch central bank governor Nout Wellink who was said to have commented, in December 2013, that the hype around Bitcoin was worse than Tulip mania because ""at least then you got a tulip in the end, now you get nothing""."
Twitter fire hose,"A syndicated data feed of all the tweets sent - an estimated 500 million tweets a day - which Twitter's data partners pay to get access to. Gaining access to the Twitter fire hose, or firehose, means gaining access to that feed. The data companies charge customers for analysis of the feed, from tracking trends in real time to analysing consumer sentiment towards particular products or advertising campaigns.  Access is usually granted on a scaled commercial basis with applicants being charged a certain amount for a access to a certain percentage of the fire hose. Nonetheless, improvements in big data analysis have ensured that there is growing demand from social media analytics companies for access to the fire hose.   fire hose in the news In October 2013 a report looked at the increasing interest in Twitter from traders. The idea was that market moving gossip can be 'heard' by applying computer filters to key words in the Twitter fire hose, or data feed. The report pointed out that other attempts to use Twitter to point to market sentiment had been less successful. In London, Derwent Capital set up the first Twitter hedge fund in 2011, hoping to mine mood statement data, but quietly closed it again a month later.  In December 2013 it was reported that Apple had acquired Topsy Labs, a social media analytics company, in a deal thought to be aimed at improving its advertising services."

UCITS,"Ucits stands for Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities. Ucits provides a single European regulatory framework for an investment vehicle which means it is possible to market the vehicle across the EU without worrying which country it is domiciled in. Designed to enhance the single market while maintaining high levels of investor protection, Ucits funds have also become successful in Asia and Latin America because the Ucits 'label' means investors can have some assurance that certain regulatory and investor protection requirements have been met. The creation of the Ucits system also brought costs down for fund providers because it means they no longer had to create a new investment vehicle for each country in which they intended to market the product.    Ucits in the news In September 2013, it was reported that talks on Ucits V, which would contain the latest EU mutual fund market reforms, had hit a stumbling block. Originally intended as a relatively uncontroversial alignment of Ucits and AIFMD (the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive) in the areas of depositaries, sanctions and remuneration, the talks had turned into heated discussions on fund managers' remuneration and restrictions on performance fees. In October 2013, it was reported that Asia was making rapid strides in its attempts to create its own version of the Ucits harmonised framewlrk for product regulation that would allow funds from one state to be distributed in another. In January a mutual recognition platform was proposed for public funds between Hong Kong and mainland China. In September, the finance ministers of Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed a statement of intent to develop a passport for cross-border fund sales and in October the regulatory bodies of Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand announced they would try to create the same thing. Total net assets in Ucits vehicles stood at  6.5tn at the end of June 2013, according to data from the European Fund and Asset Management Association."

UK Help to Buy mortgage scheme,"There are a number of Government schemes to help individuals who are unable to afford to buy a home, two of which are help to buy equity loans and help to buy mortgage guarantees. Help to buy equity loans are available in England to all buyers for new builds with a purchase price of up to  600,000. The property must be the individual s only property and cannot be sublet. The loan from the Government is for up to 20 percent of the purchase price, dependent on the individual having at least 5 percent of the purchase price as a deposit and a mortgage of up to 75 percent to cover the rest. There are different home ownership schemes in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. [1]   finding lenders on the Help to Buy scheme In October 2013, only two lenders, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, had confirmed they were taking part in the scheme from the outset. HSBC was due to join the scheme later in 2013 and Virgin Money and Aldermore, a small lender, were planning to launch products in 2014. Critics of Help to Buy said it would inflate house prices making house prices even more unaffordable. In addition, they said the scheme failed to deal with the root cause of the problem which was a lack of housebuilding. The chancellor George Osborne said the scheme would be in place for three years but said the Bank of England would have powers to put the brakes on should there be signs of a bubble emerging in the property market. View: Help to Buy topic page.   Help to Buy in the news In the UK Budget Day 2015 announcement, first-time buyers are to receive up to  3,000 to help them get on to the housing ladder through a new Help To Buy savings product. The UK chancellor said that for every  200 saved by buyers for a deposit, the government would add  50   equivalent to a 25 per cent subsidy for first-time buyers. The product will be available from this autumn. The maximum initial deposit will be  1,000, with maximum monthly deposits of  200, meaning it would take savers four and a half years to build up  15,000 in savings   equivalent to a 10 per cent deposit for an average British home. The product is the latest in a suite of measures all badged as Help To Buy, including equity loans and mortgage guarantees. [2]"
UK Swiss Tax Agreement,"On 6 October 2011, the UK and Swiss Governments signed a bilateral agreement to ensure the effective taxation of UK residents with accounts held in Switzerland. Unless the taxpayer authorises disclosure of details of income and gains to HMRC, and pays any associated taxes, Swiss banks will withhold tax at source on interest, dividends and capital gains for all accounts held by UK residents. However, non-domiciled individuals who can provide their bank with a certificate confirming their non-domicile status, and that they are claiming the remittance basis, will only have withholding tax levied on UK source income and gains, and remitted overseas income and gains. In addition, to settle any historic UK liabilities, a one-off charge which is a percentage of the account balance is levied.

US healthcare bill,"What would the US healthcare bill do  The healthcare reform legislation would offer or subsidise healthcare coverage for 32m people   about a tenth of the population   who are uninsured. It would also mandate that every American and legal US resident receive minimal coverage. Beginning in 2014, individuals who are out of work, self-employed or working for companies that do not offer insurance could buy coverage from  health exchanges  in which private insurers would offer different kinds of plans. About 19m people would be eligible for financial subsidies to help pay for insurance. If individuals refused to buy insurance coverage, they would be subject to a tax penalty.

US legislation,"This refers to the law making process in the USA. The passage of a bill from committee to Congress and eventually into law is a complicated process. [1] Any member of Congress can introduce a piece of legislation. Once the appropriate committee takes up the bill, they hold hearings to gather opinions from public officials and experts. When the hearings are complete, a subcommittee ""marks up"" the bill, making changes and adding amendments before passing it on to the full committee, which can choose to hold additional hearings and make revisions before sending it forward. In the House of Representatives, most bills go to the Rules committee before reaching the floor. The committee adopts rules that the chamber will use to consider the bill.A ""closed rule,"" for example, sets strict time limits on debate and forbids the introduction of amendments. These rules can have a significant impact on whether the bill passes.In the House, bills need only a simple majority of the 435 members to pass. The rules in the Senate, however, are more complicated. Once a committee refers a bill to the full Senate, any senator can object to it.If there are no objections, each senator has five minutes to speak on the bill and they can offer amendments.If, however, there are objections, then each Senator can speak for as long as they like about the bill. Senators can ""filibuster"" a bill by speaking about it at length.If the bills passed in the House and the Senate are different, as they usually are, they are then sent to  conference committee  to be reconciled. Then, changes made, the combined version must be passed again by both chambers,  except in the rare case where one chamber has agreed to simply adopt the bill passed by the other.If the bill cannot be reconciled, then it might be referred to another set of lawmakers for conference or if the differences are insurmountable, the bill dies.But, once a bill is eventually passed by both chambers, it is then sent to the president to be signed into law within 10 days. Unless, of course, the president vetoes the bill, but that is a whole other story. ExampleThese days, in practice filibuster just means the threat of blocking the vote. For example, the Republicans threaten to filibuster the Obama s administration healthcare reform bill. Sixty votes, rather than the usual 51, are needed to overcome a filibuster.

US shutdown,"Parts of the US government shut down on October 1 2013, the end of the fiscal year, for the first time since 1996, because the Republican controlled House of Representatives and Democrat-controlled Senate could not agree on a budget nor on a wider fiscal policy. In the US, government-wide spending is set by appropriation bills. If these aren't passed by the end of the fiscal year (30 September) then 'continuing resolutions' are passed to ensure that spending continues at a similar rate. Should Congress fail to agree, a 'funding gap' results. On 20 September 2013, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed the Continuing Appropriations Resolution of 2014, indlucing language that delayed the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as 'Obamacare'). On 27 September, the Democrat-controlled Senate removed the 'Obamacare'-related measures, only for them to be reinstated by the House of Representatives in the version of the resolution passed on 29 September. The Senate refused to pass this bill and failure to develop a compromise bill led to the shutdown of the federal government, due to lack of appropriated funds. As a result, 800,000 federal workers were forced into unpaid leave whereas a further 1.3m were required to work without pay until the issue was resolved. Some government agencies were affected more than others. According to the Office of Management and Budget, about 97 per cent of employees at Nasa were slated to be put on unpaid leave as well as 93 per cent of the Environmental Protection Agency. However, only 4 per cent of veterans affairs staff, 14 per cent of homeland security employees and 15 per cent of the justice department were due to be sent on leave. It was expected that most of the people responsible for the rollout of the health insurance marketplaces for Obamacare, President Barack Obama's healthcare law that also came into effect on October 1 2013, would be able to go to work because their funding is provided by the Affordable Care Act and not tied to annual spending legislation. It was unclear how long the shutdown would last because it was triggered by ideological rather than technical issues. After the Senate rejected a House bill that included a one-year delay to Mr Obama's 2010 health law, the House voted 228 to 201 for a new bill that tied government funding to Obamacare. The Senate later rejected that bill and refused an offer to form a negotiating committee with the Republican controlled House. Democrats said the offer was a ploy. Mr Obama has said he is willing to negotiate over bigger budget issues but is not willing to accept changes to Obamacare."

VAT annual accounting,"Under the annual accounting scheme businesses file only one VAT return each year, two months after the year end. They will normally make nine monthly interim VAT payments during the year, based on their estimated total liability for the year, followed by a balancing payment with the return. A business may apply to use the scheme at any time on or after the date it is registered for VAT if its taxable turnover is not expected to exceed  1.35 million for the year. A business already using the scheme can continue to do so until its annual taxable turnover reaches  1.6 million.  [1]"
VAT cash accounting,"Under the VAT cash accounting scheme businesses account for VAT on the basis of payments received and made, rather than on invoices issued and received. Whether or not this is advantageous will depend on the timing of the relevant cash flows. The scheme will effectively give automatic relief for bad debts. The scheme is open to businesses with an annual turnover of up to  1.35 million that meet certain other conditions. A business already using the scheme can continue to do so until its annual taxable turnover reaches  1.6 million.  [1]"
VAT flat rate scheme,"Under the flat rate scheme a business calculates its VAT liability as a fixed percentage of its turnover. The percentage varies from 4 percent to 14.5 percent depending on the businesssector concerned. No deduction is given for VAT incurred on expenditure; this is taken into account in setting the fixed rates. A business in its first year of VAT registration can benefit from a reduction of one percentage point in the applicable flat rate. A business can join the scheme if its taxable turnover in the next 12 months is not expected to exceed a statutory limit. Taxable turnover for this purpose means the value of all supplies subject to VAT at the standard, reduced or zero rate. A business must leave the scheme, when its annual income exceeds a set limit.

Value added tax VAT,"VAT is a tax on consumer expenditure and imports into the UK. 'Output' VAT on standard-rated supplies of goods and services is charged at each stage of the supply, and if the customers are registered for VAT and use the goods or services for business purposes, they reclaim the VAT on their purchases so that they have, in effect, only accounted for tax on the 'value added' by the business activities. Businesses are required to register for VAT if their taxable supplies at the end of any month exceed a given threshold in the previous 12 months, or will exceed that threshold in the next 30 days. The total VAT cost is ultimately borne by the final consumer. Supplies made outside the UK are (broadly) outside the scope of UK VAT, although they may be liable to VAT in another country. The three rates of VAT applicable in the UK are the standard rate of 20 percent, the reduced rate of 5 percent and the zero rate, with some items being exempt from VAT. [1]"
Veblen good,"A Veblen good is a luxury item whose price does not follow the usual laws of supply and demand. Usually, the higher the price of a particular good the less people will want it. For luxury goods, such as very expensive wines, watches or cars, however, the item becomes more desirable as it grows more expensive and less desirable should it drop in price. Veblen goods are named after the American economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen who observed the desire for luxury living and coined the phrase conspicuous consumption in his paper The Theory of the Leisure Class published in 1899. Veblen goods are not to be confused with Giffen goods which also rise in demand as they grow more expensive. Far from being luxury items Giffen goods tend to be staple food items, the increased demand for which is fuelled by poverty.   Veblen goods in the news In January 2010 a writer drew parallels between Veblen goods   such as designer handbags which no one would want if they were discounted in price  and services such as lawyers (people don't tend to want to pick the cheapest lawyer). However, in the financial system she said, the reverse was true and the driving quest was for cheaper prices, rather than better quality. In October 2013 a reader wrote a letter to the editor of the FT speaking of the notion that expensive Japanese fruits, meats and grains might start flooding world markets. She said if the world was already awash with European luxury brands in fashion, cosmetics and automobiles that can be characterised as Veblen goods, where demand increases as prices increases, why not add luxury foods from Japan."
Vix index,"The Vix index is an index of expected future price volatility implied by options contract prices.  It is often called a fear index because its value rises when investors are concerned about future volatility.  However, high values of the index do not imply that the market will fall - they merely indicate that investors expect that prices will move up or down substantially in the future.[2] The method of calculation for the Vix has varied through time. When the index was first conceived in the early 1990s, the methodology was quite simple: the volatility input was reserve engineered from a Black-Scholes pricing model given a known market option price (for at-the-money options only). In the mid-2000s, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (the Vix s parent) decided to introduce a much more technically complex approach, whereby many more option prices are used and drawing on the latest Wall Street mathematical gimmicks. A few years ago, the CBOE began to list derivatives on the Vix, a market that has grown considerably. The Vix s main importance may lie in the fact that many practitioners may influence their decisions and actions based on the level of the index, with the Vix essentially being given the power to move markets. This could be a problem for one main reason: the Vix may not truly mean what it is conventionally assumed to mean (expected volatility), and therefore we would be allowing an undecipherable ghost to move markets. [3] ExampleVix indices are computed for various instruments.  The most important Vix index is the S&P; 500 Vix index, which is computed using data from S&P; 500 options contracts.  It is a weighted average of the prices of various S&P; 500 index options contracts.  The contracts are chosen and weighted to ensure that the Vix index represents market expectations of volatility over the next 30 days. Option contract prices depend on many factors, the most important of which are the strike price, the price of the underlying instrument, the time to maturity and the expected future price volatility of the underlying instrument.  When expected volatility is high, option prices are high. Carefully chosen averages of option prices thus can estimate volatility. Vix index values are expressed in annual percentage points.  For example, a value of 20 indicates that options traders expect that returns to the S&P; 500 index over the next 30 days will evolve as though they were produced by a process that would generate returns with annual returns with a 20 per cent standard deviation, on average.  In practice, the realised standard deviation will differ from the implied standard deviation. [4]"

absolute return,"The term absolute in a mathematical sense refers to the numerical value of a number without its sign. For example, the absolute value of -7 is 7. Absolute return in the financial context has a similar connotation. It refers to investment strategies which target a return that is above zero, and in some cases, above a positive hurdle rate such as Libor. The hurdle rate is an investment performance numerical value, which is used as a target to be beaten by a portfolio manager. Absolute return can also refer to the total return (that is total gain or loss) of a portfolio or fund, as opposed to its relative return (that is relative gain or loss) against a benchmark. It is called relative because many mutual funds  performance is benchmarked against an index. However, we will use the former definition in this glossary. The vicissitude of asset returns - such as in equities where returns can range from very large positive to very large negative numbers - has resulted in an industry, which primarily resides in the hedge fund world, that promises to deliver absolute returns to its investors. These are returns that supposedly remain positive under all market conditions and cycles, and are hence also referred to as returns that are  uncorrelated  with the overall market. The reality of it is that not many funds have been able to provide consistently positive returns irrespective of market conditions. Example Hedge funds have traditionally been referred to as an absolute return strategy industry per the above definition. True to its form, the various hedge fund strategies had collectively delivered positive returns on average year after year, at least since the late 1990s. However, they collectively delivered negative returns in 2008.  This resulted in many investors losing confidence in hedge funds as an absolute return strategy, and hence they fled the industry by the hordes. From its peak of about $2.5 trillion in early 2008, the industry s assets under management had fallen to about $1.6 trillion in 2009. [1]"
absolute return fund,"This fund aims to deliver positive returns in all market conditions, with low volatility.Absolute return funds sprang up following the new  Ucits III  European regulations in 2004. These allowed managers to introduce more sophisticated financial instruments such as derivatives into their portfolios and therefore protect against downside risk and to generate higher returns, rather than simply to reduce risk.  Also they aim to beat cash returns and tend not to guarantee a minimum return. However, many of these funds have so far failed to deliver.ExampleOne reason for the fluctuating performance of the funds is that the investments and management approach vary from one fund to the next.At one end of the spectrum are managers of relatively straightforward funds who aim to protect capital by using bonds, where returns are less volatile.  Threadneedle s Absolute Return Bond, for example, invests in fixed interest such as UK gilts and corporate bonds to provide a more stable return.Others such as the Newton Real Return fund spread investments across a range of asset classes in order to reduce volatility and look to achieve higher returns. This can be a more risky strategy and relies on the manager s ability to judge the right time to shift a fund s investment holdings in and out of asset classes such as equities or cash and bonds.

abundance gaps,"A term used in positive organisational scholarship. Consider a continuum that depicts a state of normal performance in the middle, a condition of negatively deviant performance on the left, and a state of positively deviant performance on the right.  Negative and positive deviance refer to aberrations from effective functioning or normality, harmful on one end and virtuous on the other end. For example, at the individual level of analysis, physical or psychological illness would be depicted on the left with healthy functioning (absence of illness or normal health) in the middle.  On the right side is positive deviance, which may be illustrated by Olympic fitness levels or psychological flow.  At the organisational level, ineffective, inefficient, or error-prone performance would be depicted on the left side, whereas effective, efficient, profitable, and reliable performance would be located in the middle.  On the right side would be extraordinarily positive organisational performance.  The extreme right and left points on the continuum are qualitatively distinct from the center point.  They do not merely represent a greater or lesser quantity of the middle attributes.  The gap between the left side of the continuum and the middle is referred to as a deficit gap   a focus on addressing obstacles, challenges, difficulties, and problems.  The gap between the middle and the right side of the continuum is referred to as an abundance gap   a focus on addressing the difference between flourishing, virtuousness, and extraordinary performance and normally defined effectiveness. Example The Rocky Flats Nuclear Arsenal was labeled in a television news special as the most dangerous place on the American continent.  It consisted of 800 buildings and 6,000 acres   most of which were contaminated with radioactive residues.  More than 21 tonnes of weapons-grade nuclear material, 100 tonnes of high content plutonium residues, 30,000 liters of plutonium and enriched uranium solutions in tanks and pipes, and more than 258,000 cubic meters of low-level radioactive waste were on-site. Contamination existed in walls, floors, ceilings, duct work, surrounding soil, and, potentially, ground water.  A blue-ribbon commission of world experts estimated that it would takemore than 70 years and $36 billion to clean-up the site.  The company charged with leading the clean-up and closure effort could have been mired in problem solving and focused on obstacles and difficulties.

accelerated buy-back,"Some companies turn to a counter-intuitive strategy to return cash to shareholders: shorting their own stock. As companies with record cash on their balance sheets who embark on a spree of share buy-backs, a handful are using a tactic not seen since before the financial crisis, known as accelerated share repurchases (ASRs) or accelerated buy-backs (ABB).In a traditional buy-back, the company uses a broker to buy shares on the open market. It can take weeks or months to complete an announced buy-back.But with an accelerated repurchase, the company asks their broker to short the full amount immediately. In a standard short, the broker borrows shares from other holders, sells them, then later buys shares to return them to the original holder.In an ASR, the borrowed shares are not sold; the company retires them. The broker then buys shares to cover the short, with the company agreeing to cover any losses on the trade. There are several benefits to ASRs and other  structured  buy-backs, in which companies use derivatives and other tools to engineer buy-backs to achieve pre-set price or volume targets.Accelerated repurchases can generate a bigger short-term boost to share prices, as investors might otherwise ignore a buy-back authorisation that could take years to execute. Some investors are wary of ASRs, as they immediately lower a company s share count, and boost its apparent profitability on an earnings-per-share basis.  ExampleOne of the largest ASRs in 2011 was Express Scripts, a health care group, for $1.75bn. Retailer Home Depot and RR Donnelley, a printing group, have done $1bn ASRs.

[1] When a company (typically referred to as the  acquirer ,  buyer  or  bidder ) purchases a second, usually smaller, company (called the  acquiree  or  target ); the second company can either be continued as a separate legal entity or ceases to exist and the assets of the target are then integrated into the buying company. If both companies cease to exist and a third company is created from the two legacy companies, the term generally used is  merger .  The actual stake that is considered to take control over another company varies according to the legal juristiction. In many cases, it is the minimum of 50% plus one share. There are many occasions where companies acquire either minority stakes or hold a block in another company which might later lead to acquiring additional or remaining shares in the other company. Many strategic investors prefer to take complete (100%) control of the target target while most financial investors prefer to spread the risks and acquire lower stakes.[2]   acquisition in the news Most M&A; deals are structured as an acquisition.  For example, when Kraft, the American food conglomerate, announced in early November 2009 that it would seek to purchase Cadbury, the UK-based confectionary company, Kraft intended to acquire all of Cadbury.  Thus, when the deal was finalised in January 2010, the board of Cadbury agreed to recommend to its shareholders to sell all of their shares to Kraft. Following the deal closing later that year, the Cadbury shares ceased to exist and no longer traded on the London Stock Exchange.  Cadbury shareholders received a combination of cash and Kraft shares in exchange for their Cadbury shares. [3]"

This approach aims to transform managers into strategic 'actors' (leaders) through their work on meaningful projects that are of critical importance to an organisation. Learning happens from and with peers and is applied to solving real world problems. Principled, innovative and resilient leadership is especially enhanced by action learning in organisational settings characterised as entrepreneurial, uncertain, low-resource economic systems, and/or driven by fundamental social purpose to guide significant change. Example A team may be tasked to analyse a small start-up s business strategy. They may do this by studying the company s distribution models, production strategy or finance model. However, it is the insight gained from problem framing, inquiry, and an understanding of an organisation s real commitments and constraints, through a lens of personal reflection, which allows for innovative solutions that lead to systemic change.

Active ETFs remain a minuscule portion of the total ETF market.   active ETF in the news Pimco's launch of an active ETF in March 2012 was seen as a game changer. An ETF must publish its holdings daily, and the launch of the ETF would give bond investors a window into the thinking of Bill Gross, seen as a guru in fixed income markets.  In March 2013 it was reported that iShares, an ETF provider, had registered an intention to launch two active US equity ETFs. It had already registered other active ETFs but like some other fund providers had yet to go live with any products.

activist investor,"A person or group holding a significant amount of shares in a public company with the aim of influencing the decisions and structure of the organisation. [1]   activist investor in the news The best examples of the good that activists can do is when they develop theses on how to make the companies they target run differently and better before they take their positions. For example, Bill Ackman, founder of hedge fund Pershing Square, led a proxy fight against Canadian Pacific Railway, took control of the board of directors, threw the management out and doubled the share price for himself and other shareholders in the process. [2] The sweeping victory was just the latest sign that restless shareholders are frustrated with stagnant share prices and increasingly willing to challenge the executives supposed to serve their interests. During 2012 s febrile annual meeting season in North America and the UK, which became known as a  shareholder spring , management at companies such as Citigroup and Barclays were rebuked over executive pay. Even Apple   now the most valuable company in history   was forced to change the way it elects board members. [3]"
activity based costing,"Activity based costing (ABC) is an accountancy model and a type of management accounting designed to highlight the resources required to undertake a specific element of the production process. Staff costs are attributed to all activities within an organisation, thereby providing a clearer picture of where costs are generated. In essence, ABC is based upon the premise that everyone within an organisation is actually part of the costing process, regardless of whether the individual has a direct relationship with the goods or services provided. An in-depth understanding of where production costs are generated should allow managers to make better and more informed business decisions, including resource allocation. [1]"
activity model,"The activity model indicates the set of activities needed to turn a set of inputs (capital, raw materials and labour) into the firm s value proposition (benefits to customers). Examples of such activities include product development, purchasing, manufacturing, marketing and sales and service delivery. Example For instance low-cost airlines, such as Ryan air and EasyJet, have a simple value proposition - point-to-point travel at cheaper prices when compared to traditional carriers flying on similar routes. The activity model of these budget airlines involves removing some traditional frills to offer cheap ticket prices, for example, they only sell snacks and meals on board, instead of offering meals to all passengers as part of the ticket price. Using secondary airports also means that they pay lower airport fees which can help lower the ticket price. The activity model of airlines also involves generating other revenue streams such as selling advertising space on the exterior and interior of the aircraft.  All this brings extra sources of revenue, which can further help in keeping prices down for customers. [1]"
activity sampling,"The process of studying the activities of a group of workers or machines over a period of time, in order to find out how much time is spent on each activity that they do.  [1]"

additionality,"A rule or principle stating that the money spent by a government on public services such as health and education can be added to from other funds, especially European Union Grants, but cannot be replaced by those grants altogether. [1] "
additionality debate,"When setting up a project that reduces greenhouse gas emissions, one of the key criteria for eligibility is that a project would not have gone ahead without the extra funds available from the sale of the carbon credits. This rule was meant to guard against companies gaining an additional source of income from an already profitable venture. Companies complain it can be subjective and that it is hard to estimate whether a project would be financially viable without the extra income. To gain private sector funding, companies are often caught in a dilemma. Many are asked to prove that a project would be financially viable without credits, because potential lenders and investors are nervous about their price volatility. Thus companies may end up with one set of estimates for banks and another for the mechanism s board.  [1]"

Essentially software programs, they decide when, how and where to trade certain financial instruments without the need for any human intervention. [2]   algorithm in the news High-frequency traders have been at the cutting edge of development in recent years driving trading speeds across continents down to milliseconds. They have sifted through huge quantities of data thrown up by the fragmentation of markets and looked for patterns to exploit. Often HFT has focused on inefficiencies in the speed and reliability of the technology, the market plumbing. Some strategies have focused on a single asset class, such as stocks. Others have been more imaginative, looking at ways to arbitrage unusual securities across asset classes. Some have gone even further, with strategies containing complex mathematics and physics, and have borrowed from diverse industries such as defence and voice recognition. These investors are relatively few.Regulators are worried about algorithms.  Around the world, they are concerned about potential destabilising effects and damage to the integrity of the markets. But they are in a dilemma. While regulators want a stable, fair market, they also accept that innovation and efficiency is an important part of its development. Many are examining how to best oversee the market and have even considered examining the algorithm s code. But they have been dissuaded by practical considerations such as understanding it and their potential liability if an algorithm later turns rogue. So far Germany has gone furthest, demanding HFT traders are licensed. [3]"

angel investment,"Angel investments are typically the earliest equity investments made in startup companies.  Angel investors are almost always wealthy individuals and commonly band together in investor networks. Often these networks are based on regional, industry, or academic affiliation.  Angel investors are often former entrepreneurs themselves, and typically enjoy working with companies at the earliest stages of business formation.  For this reason, sometimes angel investors fund startups before the company has significant number of employees, and before there is a completion of a proof of concept of the idea that they intend to commercialise. Angel investors are typically former entrepreneurs who have experienced success in their ventures, and wish to continue working with startups in a particular industry (or geographical region) even though they have exited the entrepreneurial ventures that made them wealthy. Example Although it is difficult to obtain comprehensive data on angel investments, we do know that they play an important role in the business creation process.  Many household names, like Google, PayPal and Facebook were financed in their earliest stages by angel investors. [1]"
angel investor,"A wealthy individual who invests in a start-up company with his or her own money. [1] Also known as business angel, the individual provides equity or quasi equity funding to growth oriented private companies with the aim of achieving a financial return through capital gain at exit.  As well as money, they also provide value-added services.ExampleThe late Anita Roddick started her own business, the Body Shop, creating and selling beauty products. Roddick was keen to open a second shop in Chichester (UK) in 1976, but the bank turned down her request for a loan.The late Ian McGlinn, multi-millionaire, offered Roddick  4,000 in return for 50% equity in the business. Anita accepted the offer. With his equity investment, McGlinn became a business angel and sat on the board of the Body Shop, resigning just before it was floated on the stock market in 1984. At the time of the flotation McGlinn was worth  4 million.By 1991, McGlinn s 52 million shares were worth  150m. In 1996, McGlinn sold 3.5% of the business for  12m. When L Oreal took over the Body Shop in 2006, McGlinn s 22% stake was worth  137m. In 2007, Ian McGlinn was ranked number 28 in The Sunday Times Rich List, with an estimated worth of  146m.Innocent Smoothies, now Europe s leading smoothie maker, was set up in 1999 by three men who worked in advertising and consulting. An American business angel, Maurice Pinto, invested  200.000 in the start-up. In 2009, Coca Cola bought an 18 per cent stake in the company and increased its stake to 58% in 2010. [2]"
animal spirits,"Animal spirits refer to attitudes and emotions that can affect consumer and business confidence. Identified in the 1930s by John Maynard Keynes as an important economic driver, he said an eruption of  animal spirits  could start a virtuous circle of entrepreneurial risk-taking and investment   and further lift equities. Any benefits would wane quickly, however, if deal activity were merely the result of aggressive central bank policy action or structural changes forced by regulators.   animal spirits in the news In September 2013, a pick-up in merger and acquisition activity, share listings and corporate bond issuance   especially in the US - prompted the question as to whether animal spirits had returned to global markets. The value of merger and acquisition activity rocketed that month with Verizon s $130bn buyout of Vodafone s stake in a US wireless joint venture. In the first nine months of 2013, the value of US M&A; deals, at $854bn, had been the strongest since 2008, according to Dealogic, the market research group. Meanwhile, the business of bringing companies to equity markets had also been brisk. The value of US initial public offerings to September 2013 had been the highest since 2007. UK IPOs had had their best September for nine years, although Europe lagged behind. [1]"
ankle biter,An issue of a relatively modest amount of shares - typically with total market capitalisation of less than US$500 million.
announcement date,"This is the formal and public disclosure of a pending M&A; deal.  Prior to announcement, there may be rumours in the market about the deal and even leaks, but they have not been confirmed. The announcement is usually done through a press release and perhaps a press conference where the chief executives of the purchaser and often the target (if the deal is friendly) are available for questioning by journalists and market analysts. If the company is listed on a stock exchange, the exchange will also need to be informed on announcement day and, depending on the deal, other regulators may also need to be notified.  In some countries, the announcement date marks the time when the regulatory acquisition process starts, which determines when other items, such as the formal offer document, must be provided by the bidder.ExampleThe announcement date is when then bidder usually confirms that it will make a formal offer for the company; it is usually the same date on which the deal becomes public knowledge, but in some countries buyers can indicate that they intend to make an offer without making the formal announcement. For example, the American businessman, Malcolm Glazer, first made public his ownership of over 3% of Manchester United Football Club in September 2003, yet he did not make a formal announcement of his intent to purchase 100% of the club until May 2005, by which time he owned over 76% of the club s shares.

annuity,"An annuity is a guarantee from an insurer that they will pay you an income for the rest of your life. In effect they insure you against a very long life and running out of income. Annuities can be structured in different ways. A person who buys an annuity (by transferring a lump sum to an insurer or by investing with an insurer over a number of years) can elect to have funds allocated to a next of kin should he or she die.  Increasingly providers are seeking to assess your life expectancy as accurately as possible. If a person has been a heavy smoker or is in ill health, or even lives in an area where people die sooner, it is possible to secure a higher annuity rate (annual or monthly payout) from the insurer who is effectively betting that you will die sooner.    annuity in the news In March 2014 the UK chancellor George Osborne, in what was dubbed the biggest overhaul of the UK pension system in decades, announced that pensioners would no longer be compelled to buy an annuity. A pensions consultant writing for the Financial Times applauded the move and called it a watershed moment. She noted the changes meant anyone with less than  30,000 worth of total pension savings could now take the money in cash (up from the current  18,000 limit); while the restriction that allows only two small pension pots of up to  2,000 each to be taken as cash is to be turned into an allowance of up to three funds of less than  10,000 each to be cashed in   and still a quarter can be taken tax free. She noted that restrictions had usually lead to people with smaller pension funds buying poor-value annuities. "

asset allocation,"Asset allocation is the process of spreading, or 'diversifying', your investments across a range of different asset classes and geographical regions - to minimise the risk of all your investments falling in value at the same time, and to maximise the potential for smoother, and therefore higher, compound returns. By diversifying your investments across cash, shares, bonds, property, commodities, private equity and alternative investments, you reduce the impact of price volatility in any one of these assets classes on the overall value of the portfolio. In simple terms, it is the investment equivalent of not  putting all your eggs in one basket . Asset allocation is most effective in minimising risk when the assets chosen rise and fall in value independently of each other   ie their price movements are not correlated. The choice of asset classes in a portfolio is also the single most important determinant of investment returns, according to research by Brinson, Hood and Beebower. Asset allocation can effectively diversify the portfolio of a UK share investor through the addition of shares or funds from other sectors or geographic regions, or through the addition of shares that are less correlated with UK shares, for example government bonds, commodities and gold. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find uncorrelated assets. Managers tend to refer to different types of asset allocation. An investor might be recommended to start with a strategic asset allocation which gives the potential for the returns needed at a level of volatility he or she can tolerate. Tactical or dynamic adjustments can then be made. A simple strategic allocation for a 25-year investment term might be 50 per cent equities, 25 per cent bonds, 15 per cent property and 10 per cent commodities.  Tactical asset allocations involve a short-term deviation from the strategic asset allocation, for example by increasing the exposure to commodities when they are in demand and then reverting to the strategic level after realising short-term profits Constant weighting asset allocation involves responding to a rise or fall in portfolio values, for example, if equities rose in value to 60 per cent from the strategic 50 per cent level, shares would be sold and other assets bought to restore the weighting. Dynamic asset allocation involves the regular adjustment of the mix of assets in a portfolio to take advantage of changing market conditions. For example if shares were rising, more might be bought in anticipation of continued gains.[1]   Learn more at the FT Money Gym   asset allocation in the news In January 2014, an FT writer considered the wisdom of investing in a stock-picking or an asset allocation strategy. The former would involve identifying particular companies that were going to do well, while the latter would have involved a broader decision to invest in a particular market or sector. He said that in 2013 a hard working and lucky investor might have been able to get good results following a stock picking strategy in UK markets, but would have performed equally well following a far simpler passive approach to US stocks where a tracker on the S&P; 500 would have returned 31.5 per cent over the year."

asset backed contributions,"In pension terms, an asset backed contribution (ABC) arrangement is a contractual agreement between a pension fund s trustees and the sponsoring employer.

[1] ExampleThe housing market booms, in Spain and Ireland, were fuelled by low borrowing costs. Their bursting has strained banking systems. [2] "
asset class,"A broad group of securities or investments that tend to react similarly in different market conditions. Individual asset classes are also generally governed by the same rules and regulations. There are three basic asset classes: equity securities (stocks), fixed-income securities (bonds), and cash equivalents (money market vehicles). Real estate, commodities and derivatives are also considered asset classes by some. [1] Bonds, equities, property and cash are all asset classes and the way you spread your money between asset classes is your asset allocation. A risky asset allocation consists mainly of shares and a conservative allocation consists of more bonds, property and cash. ExampleDeciding how to diversify your portfolio is known as asset allocation, and one of the easiest and most popular ways of doing that is to adopt the age-adjusted mix.Quite simply that means taking your age, subtracting that from 100, putting a percentage sign at the end and then investing that much of your total portfolio into shares. So if you re 35 years old, 65 per cent of your money should be tucked away in equities with the rest invested in a mixture of bonds, property and cash. [2]"

attribution,"In fund management, attribution is the mathematical decomposition of an investment portfolio's return compared to its benchmark. The difference between the portfolio return and the benchmark return is broken down, so as to identify where the positive or negative returns are achieved. These can be stated either as a relative or an absolute.  Active fund managers typically like to identify the source of active returns that are derived from either portfolio selection choices or market timing. Attribution of these various returns at the fund manager level is done by decomposing returns against a benchmark into stock and sector returns, with an associated interaction effect.  Two-dimensionally, it is possible to show the selection and the allocation effects of a fund manager s investment decisions.  In order to attribute returns beyond a traditional two dimensional approach Brinson, Hood and Beebower developed a measurement framework that is used to identify the sources of active returns.  They decomposed the excess returns contributed by investment strategies and decisions into four components.  These are:  Asset allocation decision to over or underweight a country or sector based on the country or sector expected return. Stock selection decision to over or underweight a security based on the stock expected return. Market timing decision to over or underweight the cash composition in the portfolio based on the expected return of the market. Interaction effect which accounts for the impact of all allocation decisions. [1] "

There are several different types of auction."
auction rate preferred shares,"Called ARPS for short, these preferred securities are usually issued by a tax-exempt bond fund and offer regularly adjusted dividends. The amount of the dividend is determined by a Dutch auction every seven weeks.

auction rate securities,"The auction rate securities market, a slice of the municipal bond sector, all but collapsed in 2008 due to a dearth of liquidity and a loss of confidence caused by the credit squeeze. The market was heavily used by municipal borrowers such as local governments, schools and hospitals to raise funds for projects such as sewer systems or a new school building. The bond issuers could borrow superior triple-A ratings from bond insurers or monolines who guaranteed that both the principal and interest would be paid.

audit,"Formal examination of a company's accounts by an independent expert, called an auditor, who checks that they are internally consistent, show a true picture of a company's financial position and conform with the accounting principles governing the company's legal jurisdiction or listing base."
audit committee,"An audit committee is a selected number of members of a company s board of directors whose responsibilities include helping auditors remain independent of management. Most audit committees are made up of three to five or sometimes as many as seven directors who are not a part of company management. The audit committee plays a critical role in providing oversight and serving as a check and balance on a company s financial reporting system. The committee provides independent review and oversight of a company s financial reporting processes, internal controls and independent auditors. It provides a forum separate from management in which auditors and other interested parties can candidly discuss concerns. By effectively carrying out its functions and responsibilities, the audit committee helps to ensure that management properly develops and adheres to a sound system of internal controls, that procedures are in place to objectively assess management s practices and internal controls, and that the outside auditors, through their own review, objectively assess the company s financial reporting practices.  Example The Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the US (2002) requires that all members of the audit committee be independent. Companies must disclose whether or not the audit committee includes at least one financial expert. While in the UK Corporate Governance Code (2010) it is required that the ""board should establish an audit committee of at least three, or in the case of smaller companies two, independent non-executive directors. In smaller companies the company chairman may be a member of, but not chair, the committee in addition to the independent non-executive directors, provided he or she was considered independent on appointment as chairman. The board should satisfy itself that at least one member of the audit committee has recent and relevant financial experience."" [1]"
audit expectation gap,"The difference between the actual and expected performance of an auditor. According to the the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in 1992, the expectation gap could be defined as ""the difference between what the public and financial statement users believe auditors are responsible for and what auditors themselves believe their responsibilities are. History In 1974, Liggio is the first to define the expectation gap as the difference between the actual and the expected performance. This definition is extended by the Cohen Commission on auditors responsibilities in 1978, where the expectation gap is represented by the gap between the public expectations and needs, and the expected accomplishment of the auditors. On the other hand, Monroe and Woodliff in 1993 defined the expectation gap as the difference between the beliefs of auditors and those of the public concerning the auditors  responsibilities and duties. Jennings et al. in 1993 argued that the expectation gap represents the difference between the public expectations about the responsibilities and duties of the auditing profession and what the auditing profession actually provides. Porter in 1993 defined the 'expectation-performance gap' as the gap between the expectations of society about auditors and the performance of auditors. Example Regulators and standard setters usually propose a change in regulation following a particular event. Recently, the financial crisis was the trigger for regulators and standard setters to revisit the audit report (e.g., IOSCO 2009, EC 2010, IAASB 2011, PCAOB 2011). While narrowing the audit expectation gap has been the main objective of previous changes to the audit report (e.g revised ISA 700), currently the focus is placed on narrowing the information gap. As explained in the IAASB consultation paper (2011), the expectation gap relates to the ""difference between what users expect from the auditor and the financial statement audit, and the reality of what an audit is , while the information gap relates to  the existence of a gap between the information they [users] believe is needed to make informed investment and fiduciary decisions, and what is available to them through the entity s audited financial statements or other publicly available information"".

auditor,An outside specialist accountant that checks that an individual's or organization's accounts are true and honest. [1] 
auditor independence,"Auditor independence can be defined as a reference to the independence of internal or external auditors from parties that might have a financial interest in the business being audited. Independence requires: - Independence of mind: The state of mind that permits the provision of an opinion without being affected by influences that compromise professional judgment, allowing an individual to act with integrity, and exercise objectivity and professional scepticism. - Independence in appearance: The avoidance of facts and circumstances that are so significant that a reasonable and informed third party, having knowledge of all relevant information, including safeguards applied, would reasonably conclude a firm s, or a member of the assurance team s, integrity, objectivity or professional scepticism had been compromised. The use of the word  independence  on its own may create misunderstandings. Standing alone, the word may lead observers to suppose that a person exercising professional judgment ought to be free from all economic, financial and other relationships. This is impossible, as every member of society has relationships with others. Therefore, the significance of economic, financial and other relationships should also be evaluated in the light of what a reasonable and informed third party having knowledge of all relevant information would reasonably conclude to be unacceptable. Example AU section 220 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants  (AICPA) states that for auditor independence the auditor ""must be without bias with respect to the client since otherwise he [or she] would lack that impartiality necessary for the dependability of his [or her] findings, however excellent his [or her] technical proficiency may be.""  The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) provides a framework of principles that members of assurance teams, firms and network firms should use to identify threats to independence, evaluate the significance of those threats, and, if the threats are other than clearly insignificant, identify and apply safeguards to eliminate the threats or reduce them to an acceptable level, such that independence of mind and independence in appearance are not compromised. In situations when no safeguards are available to reduce the threat to an acceptable level, the only possible actions are to eliminate the activities or interest creating the threat, or to refuse to accept or continue the assurance engagement. In the US context independency is governed by the SEC, PCAOB and AICPA. In the case of Enron collapse in 2001, auditor s independence was violated and Arthur and Anderson fell along with its client, leaving us with only big four audit firms, 'the big four', rather than five, as previously. [1] "
auditor report,"An auditor's report is a report prepared by either an internal auditor or an independent external auditor. The auditing report has changed over the decades to improve the communication to the users of the annual reports. Standards for the audit report changed as there was a concern that users might not be correctly interpreting the auditors  intended messages (this is sometimes known as the expectation gap). Therefore, in 1978, the commission on auditors  responsibilities known as the Cohen Commission identified several possible deficiencies in the auditors  report and suggested the use of standardised language may have made the report a ""symbol"", which was not carefully read, considered or fully understood by users. Moreover, the Cohen Commission suggested that the auditors  report should be revised ato ensure it described the role and responsibilities of the auditor. Therefore, it said, the audit report needed to be corrected by applying the standard audit report. In response, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)'s auditing standards board issued statements on auditing standards (SAS) No. 58 to No. 61 in 1988. Today's audit report is more detailed and informative. For example, it has eliminated the phrase  presents fairly  and exchanged it with the phrase  in all material respects  indicating that the materiality concept was used by both the management in the preparation of financial statements, and the auditors in the audit of financial statements. Furthermore, SAS No. 58 revised the generally accepted auditing standards to require a separate explanatory paragraph in the audit report when accounting principles have not been applied consistently. Finally, in SAS No.95, the  changes in financial position  was replaced by the statement of cash flows. "

augmented reality,"Augmented reality (AR) refers to the technology that offers a real-time view of one's immediate surroundings altered or enhanced by computer generated information.  When users examine their environment through AR devices, they see information superimposed on the objects around them. The technology used to enhance images with multiple layers of other information is useful in fields where visualising images can be difficult. For example, some devices use image recognition software to work out what the user is looking at, and then overlay the user s view of the object with relevant information.  Some devices work out the location of the user, the direction in which they are looking, and then look up an online database to compute which landmarks would be visible to the user. The device can then overlay the user s view of these landmarks with relevant information. For instance, pointing a phone camera in the vicinity and direction of say, the Eiffel Tower, can trigger the AR application to recognise the landmark and overlay the image of the tower with pictures of the stages of its construction or facts about the landmark if such information is available. Example AR is used for training purposes in various fields.  For example, in the medical sector, trainee surgeons can use AR to superimpose CT scans on the image of a patient to better visualise an area of the body even before an incision is made.Similarly, BMW reportedly provides AR-based training for service engineers using special purpose goggles and audio instructions that can guide the trainee on how to disassemble and reassemble parts. [1] The Layar app on Samsung s tablet device, called Galaxy, delivers an augmented reality experience.  Using the tablet s camera, the user can scan the area and see icons appear on the screen indicating places of interests such as restaurants and shops, with another icon at the top showing their direction and proximity.

Various austerity measures have been announced since the global recession in 2008 and the Eurozone crisis in 2009. [1]  Austerity in France The French government s 2013 budget, unveiled in 2012, piled most of the burden of its  30bn savings on big companies and the wealthy, avoiding the severe cuts imposed on the broader population in Spain, Portugal, Greece and elsewhere. [2] As promised by Fran ois Hollande, the president, the budget largely spared the French the kinds of hefty cuts in public spending and employment, pensions and salaries imposed in other eurozone countries struggling to contain their sovereign debt. The savings included  2.2bn in a scaled back defence budget. Another  2.5bn would be saved in 2013 by limiting the rise in state health spending to 2.7 per cent. Extra tax measures in 2012 would add another  4.4bn. Some economists and business leaders feared that the steep tax increases and relatively modest spending curbs could undermine France s projected annual growth path of 2 per cent a year from 2014 to 2017, when it planned to have eliminated the structural deficit. [3] In addition, there were plans to tax earnings above  1m at 75 per cent. According to Jean-Paul Agon, chairman and chief executive of L Or al, one of the world s largest cosmetics company, pointed out that France would find it ""almost impossible"" to hire top talent if the government went ahead with this income tax band.

auto-enrolment,"From October 2012, the UK government is introducing the biggest shake-up of pensions in a generation when millions of people will be automatically enrolled into workplace pensions for the first time. Employers automatically have to enrol all UK workers aged between 22 years old and state pension age who earn more than  8,105 a year. In practice, employers may also enrol employees who do not meet these criteria, to ensure equal treatment. The time when you will be enrolled   or staging date   is generally dependant on the size of the organisation you work for. Employers with with more than 120,000 employees must introduce auto-enrolment by October 1, 2012. The staging dates vary, depending on size of organisation. The final deadline announced so far is July 1 2014, for companies with between 50-89 employees. Staging dates have not yet been confirmed for companies with less than 50 employees, but it is expected that they will need to auto-enrol employees no later than 2018. ExampleTo clarify things, Fidelity has produced a worked example to show exactly how auto-enrolment would work for someone earning  2,000 per month.  For example, from October 2012   2017 the minimum monthly contribution would be: - Employee pays  16 - Employer pays  20 - Tax relief from government:  4 - Total paid into the pension:  40 [1] ViewQ&A;: How auto-enrolment will work"

automatic enrolment into pension schemes,"Employers have to enrol their employees automatically into either their own (qualifying) pension scheme or the Government s new National Employment Savings Trust (NEST). Workers can opt-out of their employer s scheme if they choose not to participate. Employers are grouped according to size: the largest employers had to introduce auto-enrolment from October 2012, although the due date for the smallest employers, with 50 or more but no more than 250 employees, was April 2015. Employers have to enrol workers automatically if the employee satisfies various conditions including being over 22 years old and earning more than  10,000 per annum.[1]"
automatic stabilisers,"Automatic stabilisers, or automatic fiscal stabilisers, are budgetary arrangements that help smooth output without the explicit intervention of a country's fiscal authority. Taxes are a source of automatic stabilisation in that they tend to follow their respective tax base: they increase during upturns and shrink during downturns. Other economic variables that also tend to change automatically in line with economic conditions are also argued to have a stabilising effect on activity. For instance, unemployment benefits are seen as an automatic stabiliser, as they tend to increase in line with unemployment, feeding through to consumer spending and eventually helping to boost the job market. Other automatic stabilisers include interest rates. Automatic stabilisation is therefore largely the welcome but unintentional effect of budgetary arrangements that were designed to serve other purposes.   automatic stabiliser in the news In December 2012 an FT writer commented that the Federal Reserve's announcement that it would buy as many bonds as were necessary, rather than specifying how many it would purchase monthly, was an automatic stabiliser. In June 2013 a shortage in the supply of scrap metal was boosting investor interest in copper again. The shortage of scrap copper would result in a balanced supply of copper over the coming year, instead of a surplus. An analyst commented that scrap was an automatic stabiliser for the copper market."

availability heuristic,"The availability heuristic is a term coined by academics Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky who observed that people tend to rely on readily available recent knowledge rather than exploring other probabilities when making decisions. The ""cognitive illusion"" this creates causes havoc for investors. It means we repeatedly fail to anticipate financial disasters   such as the dotcom collapse of 2000 or the US housing market   because at the time they were unfamiliar events. It also means that once the threat of this kind of event is fresh in peoples' minds that people exaggerate its likelihood.   availability heuristic in the news In May 2012, hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry writing for the FT, wondered if the availability heuristic would result in many more years of policy making and trading driven by the threat of debt and deflation. In February 2013 an FT writer wondered if the availability heuristic was clouding views on the likely direction of bond yields."

bail bond,"A sum of money left with a court when an accused person is waiting for trial. If the person does not return for trial, they lose the money. [1] "
bail-in,"Bonds are a form of debt and as such, they rank higher than equity. This gives them a better claim to get their money back when business turns sour since the owners - equity holders - have an obligation to repay their creditors. Following the financial crisis, when governments injected hundreds of billions into banks, most bondholders were left untouched - even those holding subordinated, or junior, debt, which is theoretically designed to bear losses in times of stress. The result was anger, particularly in Brussels, and a desire to make bondholders - who after all helped lend the money that allowed banks to lend imprudently - share the burden in future by making them forfeit part of their investment to ""bail in"" a bank before taxpayers are called up on to bail it out.In theory, this will force them to be more careful with their investments and protect the taxpayer from a re-run of the recent crisis. A bail-in takes place before a bankruptcy and under current proposals, regulators would have the power to impose losses on bondholders while leaving untouched other creditors of similar stature, such as derivatives counterparties. By quickly addressing the problems of sickly institutions, they would also help stabilise the financial system by removing uncertainty. Bail-in regimes have unnerved bondholders because they are not traditional bankruptcies, which have strict rules and a court-supervised process that mean creditors are ranked in order of repayment precedence, and those in each group must be treated equally. Bondholders and many bank executives warn that such moves could have negative consequences for the wider economy. Banks finance much of their lending through bonds. Bond holders are likely to require more interest if they are at risk of losing money to a bail in. If banks  borrowing costs rise, that could in turn be priced into the costs of mortgages and other loans. Regulatory efforts to protect taxpayers could unintentionally expose them to a permanent rise in the cost of credit.  ExampleThe US has already put in place bail-in-like powers as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act passed last year. The law includes a resolution scheme that gives regulators the ability to impose losses on bondholders while ensuring the critical parts of the bank can keep running. Employees would be paid, the lights would stay on and derivatives contracts would not have to be instantly unwound, one of the areas that caused market confusion when Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008.

bail-out,"In stock trading, an investor bails out of a stock if he quickly sells all or most of his holdings despite a bad price, for instance because the share price is falling sharply and he does not want to sustain further losses.

balance sheet,"The balance sheet shows the financial status of an organisation at a particular instant in time   normally at the end of a reporting period such as a financial year, half-year or quarter. It is essentially a snapshot of the organisation at a given date and reveals many important pieces of financial information for decision-makers. Most importantly, it shows the assets or resource base of the company. Given that a company is only able to access outside capital from two sources   debt (liabilities) or equity, it reveals how the company has decided to pay for its assets. When a company has borrowed money or promised to pay an outside party, a liability arises. Alternatively, a company may receive an investment of capital to help finance its operations and growth.  Assets (land, machinery, other fixed capital, intangibles, loan receivables) should be equal to (and thus balance out) liabilities (debt, reserves) plus shareholders' equity (also known as equity capital)   in essence how the assets have been financed. Concerns are sometimes expressed about the ""size"" of a company or bank's balance sheet, which will show both assets and debt issued or borrowed by the organisation. When analysts talk about the need to reduce the size of an entity's balance sheet they usually mean that the entity has to reduce the amount of debt. Equally, strengthening a balance sheet usually means the entity intends to increase the amount of equity. It is possible to view balance sheets of listed companies by clicking on hyperlinks to that company's name on the FT's website, or by visiting the FT's markets data section     Balance sheet in the news In May 2014 an FT report covered the decision by Deutsche Bank to tap investors in an  8bn capital raising.

bank capital,"Bank capital is the value of the bank's assets minus its liabilities, or debts. Assets include cash, loans and securities, while liabilities cover customer deposits, and money owed to other banks and bondholders. If all the assets were sold and all the debts repaid, the value which would be left over is equal to the bank s equity. A bank's capital is made up of certain loss-absorbing bonds, as well as its equity. These bonds include additional tier 1 bonds and tier 2 bonds. These bonds have equity-like features, which is why regulators allow them to count towards a banks' capital. The more capital there is, this means the bank can absorb more losses on its assets before it becomes insolvent. Since the 2008 global financial crisis began, bank capital has been in the spotlight. Regulators, which act on behalf of governments, require this to be above a prescribed minimum level. Typically capital is measured as a ratio against a bank's risk-weighted assets. [1]"

The term is said to have been coined by Leon Degrelle, a right wing journalist, in the 1930s. It is a contraction of the terms gangster and banker and is frequently applied in situations where vulnerable people have been exploited, such as in the US subprime loan scandal that precipitated the 2007/2008 financial crisis.   bankster in the news Bankster is a term that has often been used on FT Alphaville, for example in a April 2012 piece discussing whether the FSA was more interested in justifying its existence than in justice per se. It gained more mainstream attention when The Economist used the term to headline a piece about manipulation of Libor in July 2012   a development that did not go unnoticed in FT Alphaville."
bao dao bond,"Bao dao bonds are the colloquial name given to all non-Taiwan dollar debt issued in Taiwan. At the beginning of 2013 the term was being used to describe the first renminbi denominated bonds. Bao dao is Chinese for ""Formosa"" the old name for Taiwan which itself literally translates as Treasure Island. Some news organisations therefore dubbed the new renminbi denominated bonds as Treasure Island bonds. HSBC called them Formsoa bonds and others are referring to them as ""bao dao"" bonds. It is hoped the renminbi denominated bao dao bonds will rival Hong Kong's dim sum bonds in creating an offshore renminbi market. The Financial Times referrered to the new renminbi denominated bonds as ""renminbi Formosa bonds"".   Bao dao bonds in the news At the end of February 2013 the Financial Times reported on the sale of the first ""renminbi Formosa bond"". It was issued by Chinatrust and the Rmb1bn note, which matures in 2016, sold at 2.9 per cent, compared with an average of 3.9 per cent for renminbi bonds in Hong Kong, according to data from the Bank of China. It was reported that Hong Kong's dim sum bonds are almost exclusively short in tenor, with a typical duration of two to three years. However, the addition of Taiwan's market, thanks to the longer-term investment needs of its large insurance industry could change that. At the beginning of March 2013 it was reported that the new  bao dao bonds were part of a broad memorandum of understanding on cross-strait currency clearance signed by China and Taiwan in August 2012."

A common confusion would be to describe the increase above as a 1 per cent rise, rather than a one percentage point rise. Using basis points (bps), or ""bips"" as they are known colloquially, avoids any ambiguity.[1] Bond spreads, the difference between bonds of similar quality and different maturities, or of different quality and the same maturity, are usually expressed in basis points (bps). Basis points are also used to express percentage changes in costs or prices of other securities, such as mortgage loans.   Basis points (bps) in the news At the end of 2012 analysts were predicting an end to the bond bull run. The risk-free rate   that is, the yield on benchmark Treasuries   was said to be mispriced as a result of buying by the US Federal Reserve.

In strict percentage terms, a stock with a beta of 0.75 is likely to rise or fall 0.75 per cent if the market rises or falls 1.00 per cent. Low-beta stocks are also called defensive stocks because investors like to hold them when the market is on a downtrend or is particularly volatile. High-beta stocks tend to be favoured when the market is rising steadily and investors are happy to take greater risks in order to maximise returns.     Usage on the FT   The beta data point appears on all of our equity tearsheets pages.  We use Beta 5Y from the Multex Ratios and Statistics table, which is provided to us by Reuters.

big data,"Big data is the term used to describe the huge volumes of data generated by traditional business activities and from new sources such as social media. Typical big data includes information from store point-of-sale terminals, bank ATMs, Facebook posts and YouTube videos. Companies use sophisticated software to analyse this data looking for hidden patterns, trends or other insights that they can use to better tailor their products and services to customers, anticipate demand or improve performance. ExampleCompanies and other organisations, including governments, have for many years been collecting, and slowly sifting through so-called structured data. These are data, like a sales ledger, that are already well-organised and therefore relatively easy to process. But more recently, there has been an explosion in the amount of  unstructured  data like video clips or facebook posts. Their lack of an identifiable structure makes them much more difficult to analyse, but these information promise to provide the most valuable insights for a company. For example, Facebook posts could tell brands what consumers think of their products. [1] ViewIn depth: big dataFT explainer: The rise of big data"

big government,"Big government is a term generally used in a pejorative manner by factions on the political right or by those who believe in individual freedoms to describe a government that is too intrusive in too many areas of individual citizens' lives. This could include criticisms of governments that try to exercise too much control over business, but also includes criticisms of governments that aim to provide too much welfare, or are too prescriptive on preventative health issues, for example by trying to influence behaviour on smoking or eating. Typically, when people use the term big government, they are also describing a government that is physically large and expensive to run.   big government in the news After listening to US President Barack Obama's second inaugural address in January 2013, at least one commentator remembered President Ronald Reagan's promise 32 years earlier that ""the era of big government is over"". Obama's speech hinted that he intended to protect Medicare and Social Security as well as invest in younger generations   all big government moves that had been criticised as such by opponents in the Tea Party populist movement.

billion,"Old textbooks and dictionaries often point to a distinction between US and UK definitions of the term ""billion"":  US definition    1,000,000,000 or 10 to the power nine  (or one thousand million) UK definition   1,000,000,000,000 or 10 to the power 12 (or a milllion million)  This distinction was confusing and now has completely fallen out of use. The world has adopted the US system and a billion refers to 1,000,000,000. The old UK definition is usually called a trillion, although the Financial Times style is '000bn'.

biofuel,"Biofuel is liquid fuel that is made from animal or biological materials. This type of fuel is seen as an alternative to environmentally damaging fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas. First-generation biofuels are produced from rape seed, palm oil or consist of ethanol produced from corn or sugar, and biodiesel produced from vegetable oils. Second-generation biofuel uses plant waste and algae rather than crops. ExampleThe production of first-generation biofuels has also been blamed for driving up food prices. Such fuels came into vogue after the EU s 27 member states agreed in 2008 that each should derive at least 10 per cent of their transport fuels from renewable sources by 2020 as part of a landmark legislative package to combat global warming. Since then, biofuels have come under scrutiny for their role in global food shortages and criticised by environmental groups, who argue the EU policy encourages farmers in Indonesia to clear forests in order to grow crops for use as fuel in Europe. As a result, they argued, biofuels were ultimately triggering the release into the atmosphere of more of the carbon dioxide linked to global warming than was commonly understood. [1] Brazilian ethanol, made from sugarcane, is a type of biofuel in production that delivers the greatest reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and is significantly cheaper than conventional petrol at current oil prices. However, Brazil s exports are hampered by trade barriers in many countries, and could never meet world demand. [2] ViewBrussels to unveil new biofuels policy"

biosimilar,"Biosimilar is the term applied to a biological medicine which is similar to another that has already been approved for use. Biological medicines are derived from a biological source such as a bacterium or yeast. They can consist of relatively small molecules such as human insulin or complex molecules such as monoclonal antibodies. Biosimilars are part of a broader family of generic drugs   drugs which are copies of patented drugs but which are authorised for sale after the original drug's patent expires. Critics of biosimilars argue that they are not the same as the original drug because they do not go through such stringent testing which means they carry more potential safety risks.   biosimilar in the news In June 2013 European regulators approved the first biosimilar generic versions of a complex biological medicine threatening to dent profits of Big Pharma. In October 2013 an FT writer pointed out that although it was due to be given approval, Hospira, the company that had been given approval to market the rheumatoid arthritis drug, would have to market directly to doctors and monitor the drug's use to detect any differences in safety compared with the original. This would mean it would not achieve the same price discount as generic copies of more simple medicines had done in the past."

black swan,"An event or occurrence that deviates beyond what is normally expected of a situation and that would be extremely difficult to predict. This term was popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book ""The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable.""  Mr Taleb is a finance professor and former Wall Street trader. [1] He took his title from the shock that Europeans experienced when they discovered black swans in Australia. Until then, their data told them that all swans were white, so the discovery was unexpected. A black swan in markets is an event that has not occurred in the past, thus rendering useless risk management models based on historic data. Such a risk model would assume that all swans were white. Mr Taleb suggests his idea has been misunderstood. The problem, he told the CFA Institute in 2008, is not that black swans occur often.  Rather, it is that they have truly catastrophic and unpredictable effects when they do happen, and so risk managers should concentrate on guarding against them.

blockchain,"When people invest in Bitcoin, the money is going into into the underlying technology - known as blockchain - not the payment instrument itself. The blockchain is essentially a giant record book of all Bitcoin transactions, it is to Bitcoin what the internet is to email. This is the decentralised network where every bitcoin transfer is verified, processed and written down. It has the potential to make economic interactions cheaper, faster and more secure. The idea is to remove the need for middlemen like banks to vouch for facts, such as a person s identity or the health of their finances   authentication processes that can be slow and costly, and vulnerable to corruption and cyber attacks. Instead, the blockchain relies on a combination of code-breaking and crowdsourcing that aims to create a self-maintaining and reliable system of record.  It s a giant accounting ledger that everybody agrees to but nobody owns,  says Peter Kirby, president of Factom   a US start-up that helps developers build products on the blockchain.                The technology is also a big electronic system and on top of which you can build applications. Currency is just one. Land registries, identity storage and peer-to-peer stock exchanges are just some of the potential uses of the blockchain, but there are big risks, as over time the cost of maintaining the technology will rise due to tougher regulation.   Blockchain in the news In February 2013, an FT mentioned that experts said the blockchain infrastructure is one reason why, despite the scandals and wild swings in the bitcoin price, venture capitalists and traditional financial services groups continue to make bets on bitcoin companies. An Australian peer-to-peer software company is using the digital currency to create an online record book called Blocktrace. This works by creating digital certificates, stored in the blockchain, that are mapped on to diamonds. The idea is to reduce fraud and eliminate the patchwork of third parties that perform identity and value checks. [1]"

blog,"A webpage containing information about someone's activities or interests. People who read a blog can add their own opinion about what it contains. [1]  A blog or weblog is a content management system that allows a user with no technical knowledge to create a dynamic webpage, typically with a chronological structure.  Usually, readers can add comments and blogs are characterised by so-called  permalinks  - these are permanent links that maintain consistency as they move from the front page to the archives. Blogs generate a loudspeaker effect on the web, since they get indexed by search engines in an efficient way.  Usually blogs are frequently updated and have a high link density since it is customary to link to the sources used in the text.  Also, they are written in clean code as the code is generated automatically, thus optimising their visibility. ExampleBlogs became immensely popular in 2003 when Google bought Blogger, a blogging service created by the startup Pyra Labs, the ease of use determined a huge growth that was crucial to the development of the so called  conversational web ,  social web  or  web 2.0 .

blue ocean strategy,"Blue ocean strategy generally refers to the creation by a company of a new, uncontested market space that makes competitors irrelevant and that creates new consumer value often while decreasing costs. It was introduced by W. Chan Kim and Ren e Mauborgne in their best-selling book of the same name.                        The following guidelines may be proposed to companies seeking to create blue oceans:1. Identify the key features/ dimensions that currently define a product/ service.2. Identify a group of customers who only value a subset of these features. These customers may be currently using lower end alternatives, or may be very different from the current customers while having needs that are similar at some fundamental level. 3. Make the product or service not as good on the dimensions less valued by new target customers. This step is counter-intuitive but necessary in order to create value while decreasing cost. 4. Consider making the new product or service better on the dimensions valued by the new target customers and/ or introducing new features targeted to these new customers. ExampleConsider Yellow Tail, the company s initial success was achieved with a wine of ordinary quality (according to the standard criteria used to evaluate wine), targeted to beer drinkers.The steps above would take the following form for this innovation: 1. Wines traditionally compete, among others, on aging quality, vineyard prestige and complexity. 2. Yellow Tail identified a significant group of customers who were intrigued by wine, but who were intimidated by the difficulty of selecting and enjoying this product. These customers were typically reverting to beer as a lower end alternative. 3. Yellow Tail developed a line of wines that were not as good than even the lower end of the market on the traditional dimensions of competition identified in step 1 and not valued by the customers identified in step 2. 4. Yellow Tail introduced new features or dimensions that were not traditionally used to evaluate wine, but that were valued by their target customers, such as  ease of drinking,   ease of selection,  and   fun.  These new dimensions enabled the company to steal customers from the beer market. [1]"

board,The group of people who have been elected to manage a company by those holding shares in the company. A group of people who make important decisions or rules about how an institution operates and make sure that these rules are obeyed. [1]  
board composition,"Board composition normally concerns issues related to board independence (including independence of board committees), diversity (firm and industry experience, functional backgrounds, etc) of board members, and CEO duality. In general, directors can be classified into three categories. Insider directors or management directors are salaried employees, such as the CEO, president, CFO or COO. Related or affiliated outside directors are those who have a pre-existing relationship with the firm, such as family relatives and retired executives. Independent outside directors are directors who have no personal connections or business dealing with the firm. Taken together, board independence refers to a corporate board that has a majority of independent outside directors. Compared to an insider-dominated board, an outsider-dominated board is believed to be more vigilant in monitoring managerial behaviors and decision-making of the firm. However, having an independent board alone may not be sufficient to guarantee good governance control. It is likely that some independent board members might be brought in to serve as tokens or window dressing in order to fulfil the minimum regulatory requirements. Moreover, outside directors might not be truly independent from firm executives if they feel indebted to the CEO who hired them or have developed strong friendship with the top management at the focal firm over the years they have served on the board. In addition, a board that consists of directors with a diverse set of functional expertise (marketing, engineering, finance, etc) industry experiences, educational qualifications, ethnic and gender mix might be better equipped to deal with a wide range of issues facing the firm and provide executives with advice and consultation from multiple perspectives.  Another issue related to board composition is whether a CEO also serves as a chairman on the company board (so-called CEO duality). Although CEO duality has its merits and could be desirable in some conditions, the fact is that a CEO holding dual positions in the firm suggests a strong, powerful leader with a great control over firm decision-making, which in turn, might weaken the board s governance role as a management watchdog.  Under such circumstances, setting up a lead director role among outside directors can effectively balance the power of a CEO and other insiders. Example Although backgrounds and experiences of directors can convey basic qualifications of corporate board members, such information is not sufficient to determine a board s level of vigilance in its oversight role. A notorious example would be the governance failure of Enron s board, which was composed of mostly financially sophisticated figures with elite social status and Ivy League education. Ironically, Enron s board was named one of the top five boards in 2000 by Chief Executive Magazine, one year before the firm collapsed.

Once issued, bonds - including the right to receive the issuer's repayments - can be traded on established markets. In most cases, a bond is redeemable at face value on a particular date, and has a fixed rate of interest that is paid at regular intervals through to maturity (see straight bond). The coupon rate is the interest rate attached to the bond, while the yield is the coupon rate divided by the price at which the bond was purchased. There are several different types of bond, including zero-coupon bonds (normally sold at a discount to make up for the lack of interest payments) and convertible bonds (convertible into shares).

bond ladder,"When an investor decides to hold bonds, there are a variety of strategies with respect to the maturity dates of the bonds for constructing a bond portfolio. Some are simple and others highly complex. The simplest is a bullet portfolio, in which all of the bonds mature at the same time. Another simple strategy is a barbell, in which a significant portion of the portfolio is put into a shorter-term maturity, a significant portion into a longer-term maturity. Yet another of the simple strategies is a bond ladder. In this case, the maturities are spread evenly across a fixed horizon. For example, if an investor selects a 10-year horizon, a pure bond ladder would be to have 10 per cent of the portfolio mature in one year, 10 per cenr in two years, and so on up until the final 10 per cent matures in ten years. A bond ladder may be set up for several reasons. One is that the investor wants to create annuity income. In the above example, the investor has the cash from the maturing bonds available each year for ten years. Another reason is that the investor decides that he or she does not want to guess the direction of interest rates, and is happy just to accept what is known as the current term structure of interest rates. In this case, as bonds mature each year, the investor roles the maturing bonds over into a new set of ten-year bonds. Hence, the portfolio is maintained as a 10-year ladder on an on-going strategy. [1]"
bond market,The buying and selling of bonds. [1] 
bond note,An official document allowing imported goods to be removed from a building where they have been kept because no import tax has been paid on them yet. [1] 
bond points,"Bond points refer to the fact that unlike our system for quoting prices on stocks, price quotations on bonds are in the form of a secret code. For example, if a stock is quoted as trading at 80, then this means $80 per share. So, if I wanted to buy 100 shares, I would have to pay $8,000 plus commission. Bonds are quoted in terms of bond points. Technically, a point is 1 per cent per $100 of par value. In practice, one can simply think of a price quoted in bond points as being a percentage of par value.  Thus, a bond that trades at 80 is trading at 80 per cent of par value. Most bonds have a par value of $1,000. Hence, a bond trading at 80 would be trading at a price of $800 per bond. To further complicate matters, with US government bonds, fractional points are in quoted in terms of 32nds. For example, at the time of writing, the Treasury bond with a 3 1/8 coupon rate that matures in February 2042 is quoted as 100:06 bid and 100:08 ask. The bid price is what one would receive from a dealer if the investor was attempting to sell his or her bonds, and the ask price is what the investor would have to pay to buy these same bonds. Hence, the purchase price is 100 8/32% of par, which translates into 100.25%. For a $1,000 par value bond, the investor would have to pay $1,002.50 for the bond itself. [1]"

boss-napping,"Nothing to do with managers caught sleeping at work, but an industrial tactic involving the kidnapping of managers by workers to achieve better terms and conditions or protect jobs. Boss-napping became commonplace in France in 2009, when managers at Caterpillar, 3M and Sony were all held hostage by their employees demanding fewer lay-offs and better pay. [1]   boss-napping in the news In January 2014, trade union members at a Goodyear tyre plant in northern France took two of their managers hostage in a pay-related dispute.  This marked the return of the boss-napping phenomenon that dogged industrial relations in the country following the financial crisis. The managers were locked in a room at the plant, with union members vowing to keep them hostage until they win guarantees over pay bonuses and severance packages. The situation came to an end when two policemen entered the US-owned factory and freed the two managers. For years, the company tried to close the Amiens plant though with little success. In March 2013, workers protested against the planned closure clashed with police outside Goodyear s headquarters in the suburbs of Paris. [2] In the summer of 1993, the boss of champagne house Mo t & Chandon was trapped in his Epernay offices overnight with only a fridge full of bubbly for company. Meanwhile, workers barricaded themselves in the cellars and cracked open a few of the 95m bottles laid down in the dusty warren of tunnels to protest against the group s plan to commemorate its 250th anniversary with 250 job cuts. In 2009, the economic crisis and rising tide of factory closures and restructurings had prompted an unusually high rate of corporate hold-ups.

bottom of the pyramid (BOP),"The Bottom of the Pyramid (BOP) is a socio-economic concept that allows us to group that vast segment  - in excess of about four billion  - of the world s poorest citizens constituting an invisible and unserved market blocked by challenging barriers that prevent them from realising their human potential for their own benefit, those of their families, and that of society's at large. Technically, a member of the BOP is part of the largest but poorest groups of the world's population, who live with less than $2.50 a day and are excluded from the modernity of our globalised civilised societies, including consumption and choice as well as access to organised financial services. Some estimates based on the broadest segment of the BOP put its demand as consumers at about $5 trillion in Purchasing Power Parity terms, making it a desirable objective for creative and leading visionary businesses throughout the world. One of the undeniable successes in this process is the explosion of the Microfinance industry witnessed in many parts of the world. The first person to really focus on BOP was C.K. Prahalad (1941-2010), who in the process has inspired influential leaders and countless ordinary citizens sharing his vision, to joint efforts for the unleashing of their creative and productive potential as part of an inclusive capitalist system, free of paternalism toward the poor.

In the long term, the incident can severely damage the affected brand's reputation. The key challenge for companies faced with a crisis is to restore consumer trust in the brand. For competitors, the crisis is often a great opportunity to steal consumers away from the affected brand. Example For many years, Toyota enjoyed a stellar reputation in the US  and Europe as a maker of high quality, reliable cars. That reputation was seriously dented in 2010 when the company faced a severe crisis. A spate of negative reports of sudden acceleration incidents in 2009 and 2010 led to a massive recall worldwide of Toyota and Lexus cars suspected of potentially sticky accelerator pedals or out-of-place floor mats. Several of the incidents involved accidents with serious injuries, some of them fatal.

brand social equity,"Brand equity is part of the marketers  vocabulary to refer to the value of a brand as measured by a range of criteria which might include the strength of consumer preference, the familiarity of a brand and the loyalty that consumers have to a brand versus the competition. As consumers in developed markets have become more aware of the social, ethical and environmental effects of a brand, so too have marketers become more involved with tracking the extent to which social, ethical and environmental factors can affect a brand s equity - its value to a company. The term brand social equity is now being used to refer to the value attributed to a brand based on consumer evaluation of the brand s contribution to wider society. Consumer evaluation is typically carried out through quantitative market research studies   sometimes a regular omnibus study or a more specific and analytical study, such as the Good Brand Social Equity Index. These studies allow marketers to make correlations between known and significant brand valuation measures and a brand s social equity. Quality or purchasing preferences will be key features of such an exercise. Marketing guru Philip Kotler foresaw, in 1972, that consumerism would lead to pressure for healthier and more socially and ecologically responsible products. Brand social equity is one of the terms now being used to measure this emerging consumer pressure. Examples Products with high brand social equity include Ecover, this company produces environmentally friendly cleaning and laundry products.  Another example is Caf direct, the fairtrade hot drinks company. [1]"

brushing," Brushing  essentially consists of online sellers creating fake orders   the merchant sends out an empty box or delivery envelope accordingly, but refunds the money paid by the  purchaser . Online traders can recruit their friends, relatives and even professional fraudsters to make fake orders because shipping more goods would artificially inflate their reputation   and therefore a better chance to garner more real sales   on ecommerce websites.   Brushing in the news In 2014, an FT writer wrote that brushing highlighted the headaches of policing third parties on e-commerce sites and applied to all sites that have open supplier platforms, such as Ebay and Amazon. However, Chinese ecommerce company Alibaba was the most affected due to its sheer size in the Chinese market. [1]"
bubble,"When the prices of securities or other assets rise so sharply and at such a sustained rate that they exceed valuations justified by fundamentals, making a sudden collapse likely (at which point the bubble ""bursts""). For example, the housing market value booms, in Spain and Ireland, prior to the 2007/8 financial crisis, were fuelled by low borrowing costs. Their bursting strained banking systems. In theory, at least, it should be relatively straightforward to detect the formation of a bubble in any asset. However, outcomes of bubbles can sometimes be unpredictable, as Andrew Odlyzko of the University of Minnesota points out in his paper on the Victorian British railway manias in the 1800s. In the 1830s a massive expansion of the railways took place and railway shares soared. However, good times did not last and shares collapsed during a general financial crisis in 1837. But although costs of expanding the network turned out to be much higher than imagined, demand had also been underestimated. By 1844 shareholders who had held their stock were looking at annualised gains of nearly 10 per cent and investors who bought at the trough quadrupled their money. The success of the first railway mania led to a new railway mania. 4,500 miles of new lines were sanctioned by parliament and forecasters estimated that passenger traffic would be four times that which had previously travelled in horse-drawn vehicles   an estimate that was uncritically accepted by shareholders. In fact, forecast passenger numbers turned out to be over optimistic and railway stocks shed two thirds of their value and shareholders, including the Bront  sisters and Charles Darwin suffered painfully. Although both bubbles burst, the favourable outcome for investors who didn't sell after the first one shows that not all bubbles are bad for investors.   bubble in the news In January 2014, regulators were concerned that unsuspecting private individuals might be sucked into a bubble in Bitcoin which would be particularly damaging when it burst because there were no assets underpinning its price. Economist Gavyn Davies, writing for the FT drew attention to a theory put forward by Milton Friedman decades earlier, who established that should private currency creation be permitted then competing providers would emerge until the price of the currency was reduced to the marginal cost of its creation. (In Bitcoin's case this would be close to nil)"
bubblecovery,"A bubblecovery is a term coined by financial blogger Jesse Colombo to describe what he calls a bubble-driven economic recovery spurred by cheap credit. He says the cheap credit has a tendency to flow into temporary growth-generating speculative endeavours.                          According to Mr Colombo, a bubblecovery is what preceded the global financial crisis. He explains that the Federal Reserve was concerned, in the aftermath of the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000, that the US jobs market was being slow to recover. In response it slashed interest rates from 6.5 per cent to 1 per cent, leading to a bubble inflating in the housing market. When the Fed then raised interest rates to slow inflation it popped the housing bubble.  Jesse Colombo believes the world is gripped in a new bubblecovery being driven by what he calls the CCC Aches   which stands for China, Commodities, Canada, Australia, College (US higher education loans), Healthcare (US healthcare costs), Emerging markets and Social media. Jesse Colombo gained media attention after the subprime crisis for correctly predicting it."

budget,"An estimate on the overall costs of a project, as in ""advertising budget""; or, in the context of company or government finances, a forecast of expenses and revenues over a particular period. The amount by which government expenses exceed income is the budget or fiscal deficit. If income exceeds spending, the government has a budget or fiscal surplus. A balanced budget is one in which spending equals revenue."
budget balance,"A balanced budget occurs when an entity s spending matches its revenue during a period of time. An excess of revenue over spending is referred to as a budget surplus and an excess of spending over revenue is referred to as a budget deficit. On average over time healthy governments run balanced budgets. Persistent government deficits lead to a crisis of confidence in the ability of a government to pay back its debt. ExampleIndeed, membership in the European Union requires countries to limit their budget deficits to 3 per cent of GDP. Unfortunately, in 2009 these limits have been exceeded by Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, Italy and the UK. Persistent government deficits lead to an accumulation of government debt, which leads to a high and rising ratio of government debt to GDP (referred to as a country s debt-to-GDP ratio). From 1980 until 2010 the debt-to-GDP ratio in the US rose from 26.1% to 62.2%, without any clear need for spending to exceed revenue during this entire time period. Governments have sometimes run budget deficits to avoid high tax rates in the face of uncertain spending and revenue. Typically, a government will run a budget deficit during periods in which spending is unusually high relative to revenue, such as times of war or recession. For instance, to finance World War II, the US ran a large budget deficit so that its debt as a fraction of GDP rose from 44.2% in 1940 to 108.6% in 1946. This debt-to-GDP ratio fell to 26.1% by 1980. In the UK, public debt rose to 238% of GDP in 1947 and fell to 42% by 1980. [1]"

business acumen,"Business acumen is keenness and speed in understanding and deciding on a business situation. In practice, people with business acumen are thought of as having business 'sense' or business 'smarts'.  They are able to obtain essential information about a situation, focus on the key objectives, recognise the relevant options available for a solution, select an appropriate course of action and set in motion an implementation plan to get the job done.  When they discover that changes are required to adapt to unforeseen circumstances, they make the adjustments as necessary and keep the activity moving forward.  They are more often right than wrong in their assessments and choices and are admired by others both for their acumen and business success. People with strong business acumen use an explicit or implicit business framework to ensure completeness and integration as they assess a business situation. The framework links the objectives of key stakeholders, the competitive strategies required for success, the people and activities needed to produce and sell products and services, and the business processes that support a manager's ability to deal with the complexity. The framework is robust and therefore generally applicable to all types of business activity.  In a particular business, this framework is often referred to as the business model. Business acumen also requires a thought process that ensures a focus on critical factors, an appreciation of the future consequences of actions taken today and the recognition that future activities require constant monitoring and adjustment when things don t go according to plan.  These three ideas are summarised by the terms mindfulness, sense-making and resilience. Business acumen is learned, not innate.  A person develops business acumen through some combination of business experience and formal training.  Such personal development requires an understanding and application of the management processes to ensure a disciplined and consistent approach to analysis and decision making. Example Steve Jobs had business acumen. It has been said that most if not all of the key technologies underlying the iPad existed prior to the creation and success of that device.  Additionally, most of the functionality provided by the iPad was already available to consumers through other devices. Jobs succeeded in creating a unique combination of functionality, convenience in use and accessibility that offered compelling value to customers, suppliers (creators of applications) and investors.  The foresight and insight that leads to such a creative merging of stakeholder interests is the essence of business acumen. [1]"

The reinvestment period starts twelve months before the disposal and ends three years afterwards. The assets that qualify for the relief include interests in land or buildings, fixed plant and machinery and ships, aircraft and hovercraft. The gain deferred will be taxable when the new asset is disposed of. There is a similar regime for the rollover of gains on the disposal of intangible assets.[1]"
business case,"An explanation of how a new project, product etc is going to be successful and why people should invest money in it. [1] "
business case for corporate social responsibility,"This is a set of arguments detailing the potential benefits gained by firms if they invest in corporate social responsibility.  Benefits include enhanced corporate image and increased staff loyalty. Example Many firms have found that acts of corporate social responsibility (CSR) can have financial benefits, such as increased product differentiation that can appeal to consumers, for example fair trade or organic goods.  They may also experience decreased operating costs.  For example, with increased staff loyalty, they have lower costs in recruiting and retaining employees and reduced turnover costs. Firms that are known for their corporate social responsibility can benefit from lower costs in setting up operations as, for example, they are not challenged by  not in my back yard protests .  This term refers to the objections raised by people who are against plans for new developments or projects near them, e.g., a nuclear power station.  One example is Wal-Mart versus Target where Wal-Mart often faces stiffer legal challenges when attempting to site new stores and has been unable to enter some locations, despite costly and extended legal battles, where Target has gained entry, such as Manhattan, New York. Firms may also have increased ease of access to favourable relationships with partners and suppliers and lower risk of regulatory fines. To the degree that these benefits exceed the costs of engaging in the acts, a business case is made.  As such, corporate social responsibility can be seen as enlightened self-interest.  This means the firm recognises that although CSR investment is costly in the near term, there will be offsetting gains in the longer term.  For example, a firm that funds a college scholarship now may become an employer of choice for talented employees years later. Often the benefits are intangible, such as improved reputation and enhanced stakeholder relationships, and so can be difficult to quantify.   The business case stands in contrast to the ethical case, which can encourage firms to engage in corporate social responsibility even where it causes financial losses. [1]"

A cycle can last anywhere between 2-1/2 and 50 years depending on which economic theory one adheres to. In practice, a cycle should contain a phase of expansion or recovery (to a peak) and a phase of slowdown or recession (to a trough). If the rates of growth and contraction are very strong, an economy could be """"booming"""" for a while at its peak, while the trough could see a phase of depression or stagnation. A trend governed by a business or economic cycle is termed cyclical."

business ecosystem,"Increasingly, businesses operate in a broader network of related businesses offering particular products or services. This is known as a business ecosystem - a network of interlinked companies, such as suppliers and distributors, who interact with each other, primarily complementing or supplying key components of the value propositions (benefits for customers) within their products or services. ExampleConsole makers such as Sony or Nintendo work with independent game developers to develop an ecosystem around the games/ software. Some games/ software can only be played on their consoles. For example, the virtual painting and drawing software ""Art Academy"" can only be used on the Nintendo DS range (handheld consoles). Building such an ecosystem around a core product increases its value to the user as such complements increase the scope of usage of the basic product. In the case of Sony or Nintendo, game consoles without the ancillary software have little or no value to the user. Ecosystems also create strong barriers to entry for new competition, as potential entrants not only have to duplicate or better the core product, that is the console, but they also have to complete against the entire system of independent complementors and suppliers that form the network.

business intelligence,"Business intelligence is the intelligence method used by businesses starting with raw data generated by businesses as an overview of their internal activity. Business intelligence has a quantitative focus. Business intelligence differs from competitive intelligence, which mainly analyses information from external data sources and where a qualitative focus prevails by means of utilisation of ideas. The quantitative process employed in business intelligence usually requires software and specific techniques which aid in managing enormous databases, such as CRM (customer relationship management) systems, data warehouse, Big Data, OLAP (online analytical processing), data mining techniques, statistical data analysis and DSS (decision support systems). The purpose of business intelligence is to detect behavioural patterns from which future behaviour can be anticipated. This enables new opportunities to be developed and facilitates an organisation's decision making process.   An example of business intelligence in use Analysis of the behaviour of customers on a website that sells books can inform the vendor. The company can gain business intelligence on transactions realised, the types of products browsed, the dates on which searches are performed, the route taken through the website and even the amount of time that customers spends on each stage. The vendor can then take informed decisions on what it should do regarding its sales policy, what products to highlight, how to energise those products ti wishes to eliminate from stock and what factors are needed to create customer loyalty."

business model,"This describes the method or means by which a company tries to capture value from its business. A business model may be based on many different aspects of a company, such as how it makes, distributes, prices or advertises its products. [1] The business model concentrates on value creation. It describes a company's or organisation's core strategy to generate economic value, normally in the form of revenue.  [2] The model provides the basic template for a business to compete in the market place, it provides a template on how the firm is going to make money, and how the firm will work with internal players (firm s employees and managers) and external players (stakeholders such as customers, suppliers, and investors). The business model indicates how the firm will convert inputs (capital, raw materials and labour) into outputs (total value of goods produced) and make a return that is greater than the opportunity cost of capital and delivers a return to its investors. This means that a business model s success is reflected in its ability to create returns that are greater than the (opportunity) cost of capital, invested by its shareholders and bondholders. Business models are an essential part of strategy   they provide the fundamental link between product markets, within the industry, and the markets for the factors of production such as labour and capital. Any resilient business model must be able to create and sustain returns for its investors over time, otherwise, it is likely to go out of business or fashion. [3] ExampleThe 'razors and blades' model used by companies such as Gilette, in which a basic product (the razor) is sold cheaply, but an essential add-on or consumable (the blade) is sold at a high price once the customer has been lured in. [4] Another example is a mobile phone company may sell handsets (the bait) at a reduced price while signing up customers to buy calls over the period of a contract (the hook). [5] Also General Motors, for many years, had an unsustainable business model as its returns did not match or exceed its cost of capital. Profitability was focused on the financing of cars, i.e. providing financing to its automotive customers, such as loans to buy the cars, through its finance subsidiary GMAC, rather than by designing and manufacturing sought after cars that are also cost competitive. When the financial crisis struck, this model encountered problems, and as GMAC had to seek a US government bailout, the company s already precarious condition turned into bankruptcy.

business narrative,"Storytelling. The use of narrative in business helps us to understand how and why businesses succeed or fail. Storytelling by sharing of actions, views and opinions shapes a business' culture and can be both a power for good, and a power for division and subversion. Bad narrative may exist in the form of divisive gossip around the water cooler, or finger pointing about mistakes and punishments. These subvert our shared responsibility to build trust, inspire others and create a healthy workplace community.  A positive narrative can help build success by celebrating and encouraging the right behaviours. Narrative in this sense has a profound impact on the attitude, behaviour and outlook of each member of a business community and ultimately affects its cohesion and success. It is the responsibility of business leaders to set the right tone from the top. To ensure that storytelling avoids the egotistical narrative that breeds division and poor performance, instead celebrating the shared values and behaviours that engage customers, colleagues and communities in the sustainable success of the business.

business sustainability,"Business sustainability is often defined as managing the triple bottom line - a process by which companies manage their financial, social and environmental risks, obligations and opportunities. These three impacts are sometimes referred to as profits, people and planet. However, this approach relies on an accounting based perspective and does not fully capture the time element that is inherent within business sustainability. A more robust definition is that business sustainability represents resiliency over time   businesses that can survive shocks because they are intimately connected to healthy economic, social and environmental systems. These businesses create economic value and contribute to healthy ecosystems and strong communities. Business sustainability requires firms to adhere to the principles of sustainable development. According to the World Council for Economic Development (WCED), sustainable development is development that  meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  So, for industrial development to be sustainable, it must address important issues at the macro level, such as: economic efficiency (innovation, prosperity, productivity), social equity (poverty, community, health and wellness, human rights) and environmental accountability (climate change, land use, biodiversity). There are a number of best practices that foster business sustainability, and help organisations move along the path from laggards to leaders. These practices include:   Stakeholder engagement: Organisations can learn from customers, employees and their surrounding community. Engagement is not only about pushing out messages, but understanding opposition, finding common ground and involving stakeholders in joint decision-making;   Environmental management systems: These systems provide the structures and processes that help embed environmental efficiency into a firm s culture and mitigate risks. The most widely recognized standard worldwide is ISO 14001, but numerous other industry-specific and country-specific standards exist;   Reporting and disclosure: Measurement and control are at the heart of instituting sustainable practices. Not only can organisations collect and collate the information, they can also be entirely transparent with outsiders. The Global Reporting Initiative is one of many examples of well-recognised reporting standards;   Life cycle analysis: Those organisations wanting to take a large leap forward should systematically analyse the environmental and social impact of the products they use and produce through life cycle analysis, which measure more accurately impacts. Firms that are sustainable have been shown to attract and retain employees more easily and experience less financial and reputation risk. These firms are also more innovative and adaptive to their environments. Example          Tech or financial firms going to a paperless office environment;          A cell phone manufacturer pursuing a  conflict-free  mineral resource supply chain;          A bank committing to and accomplishing carbon-free operations.

but-for price,"In antitrust cases brought against cartels, the but-for price is an estimate of the price that would have prevailed in the absence of there being a conspiracy designed to elevate prices above what they otherwise would have been. In US civil antitrust cases, one sees damages estimates being constructed by taking the difference between the actual price and the estimated but-for price and multiplying by the quantity purchased. To estimate a but-for price, one approach is to construct an econometric model that reliably predicts price variation during a benchmark period in which it is reasonable to assume conduct was not collusive, and then to use this model to predict what prices would have been during the period of collusion.  For example, economists might use a predictive econometric model that accounts for demand and cost factors relevant for the product, market, and industry under consideration. [1]"

Example In an attempt to mitigate buyer resistance, the prosecuted cartel in carbon brushes (the conductive element that transfers electricity from a hot rail or wire to a moving electric tram or train) discussed and agreed upon artificial  justifications  for their collusive price increases, including such things as the claim that environmental requirements cost extra, that raw material prices had increased, and that wages had increased.

call option,"A call option is a derivative that consists of the right, but not the obligation, to buy a certain amount of the underlying instrument at a given price, the strike price, on or before a certain time. Here the 'underlying instrument' means a security such as a bond or a share, a commodity, or sometimes another derivative or financial product. In the case of the simplest form of option, a European option, the purchase can only be made at one point in time, the exercise time. American options can be exercised at any time up to an expiry date. If, at the exercise time, the price of the underlying is greater than the strike price of the option, the holder realises a profit of the difference between the two prices, less the amount paid for the option. If on the other hand the strike price is greater than the price of the underlying asset, the option will expire worthless, since the holder will choose not to exercise the right to buy. So an option has an unlimited potential upside, but a limited downside - in no case can one lose more than the price paid for the option. Call options on a company's stock are often given to executives as an incentive. If they are successful in raising the share price of the company, the executives stand to profit. If not, then their options lose their value. European options are among the simplest derivatives to value, and the European call is used in the classic example of risk-neutral pricing, with the famous formula given by Black and Scholes. The Black-Scholes formula always gives a price for a call which is greater than its redemption value would be, if it were to expire immediately. In the absence of price changes, the value of the option will always decrease. This loss to the holder is compensated by the gains which can be made by delta-hedging the option.[1]"
call premium,See callable bond
call price,"Borrowers, such as corporations and governments, like to have the opportunity to repay debt early, so they frequently incorporate a call price into the terms of a bond issue. These borrowers are then able to buy a bond issue back at the call price, and replace it with a cheaper one by calling in the current bond issue. Most corporate bonds are callable, but a few are non-callable. The call price is equal to the par value of bond plus a call premium. Call premiums can be set in a variety of ways. For example, a call premium might equal one year s worth of interest. This call premium may be amortised over the life of the bond issue so that it approaches zero as the bond matures. Some bonds are non-callable for an initial period of time, and then become callable. When a company calls a bond issue, it is almost always the case that the company makes substantial economic savings in terms of future interest payments, at the expense of the bond investor who will be forced to reinvest his or her money at a lower interest rate. Once a bond has been called, the issuer has no legal obligation to make any interest payments after the call date. Example  A bond for XYZ Corp. matures in 25 years at a par value of $1,000. It is noncallable for the next ten years, and thereafter it is callable at a price of $1,050. [1]"

capital accumulation,The process of saving money rather than spending it. [1] 
capital adequacy,A measure of whether a bank has enough capital in relation to possible losses on loans to borrowers. [1] 
capital adequacy ratio,"Measure of the financial strength of a bank, expressed as a ratio of its capital to its assets. The Bank for International Settlements' Basel committee for international banking supervision has drawn up global standards for capital adequacy and also established criteria for the classification of loans in terms of risk. The Basel committee's target capital adequacy ratios - how much capital a bank should set aside as a proportion of risky assets - are called Basel ratios, or sometimes BIS ratios or just capital ratios."
capital allowances,"Capital allowances are available on certain categories of expenditure to replace commercial depreciation, for which a tax deduction is not available. Broadly, capital allowances are available on plant and machinery on a reducing balance basis, although special rules apply to some assets including motor vehicles (see capital allowances for motor vehicles) and long life assets. There are also special rules for certain assets in Enterprise Zones. Plant and machinery which is categorised as  integral features  in a building or as a  long-life  asset is given a reduced allowance, again on a reducing balance basis.   Other allowances are available for assets such as ships, mines and oil wells, certain energy-saving or environmentally friendly assets, costs relating to the conversion or refurbishment of some flats over shops and of certain business premises (see Business Premises Renovation Allowance), and certain biofuels plants (see also Enhanced Capital Allowances), and expenditure in some Enterprise Zones. [1]"
capital allowances for enterprise zones,"Enterprise Zones are designated areas that offer a range of benefits with the aim of attracting new businesses to an area or promoting investment from existing businesses. The range of incentives offered varies and may include: relief on local business rates; tax credits on investments in capital assets; relaxing or simplifying planning processes to make construction of premises cheaper and quicker and access to superfast broadband. Enterprise Zones in assisted areas also qualify for enhanced capital allowances. These allowances are available for five years from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2017. This will mean that first-year allowances of 100 per cent will apply, where a number of conditions are met, to companies investing in plant and machinery for use within Enterprise Zones in designated areas.[1]"
capital allowances for motor vehicles,Capital allowances for motor vehicles vary depending on the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions level of the vehicle. Businesses are entitled to a 100 percent first-year allowance on the purchase of new vehicles with CO2 of less than 75g/km. [1]

capital assets,"Something such as land, buildings, or machinery used by a business to produce its goods or services an asset on which capital gains tax must be paid if it is sold. [1]  Originally, the term meant fixed assets such as land, buildings and machinery, and other assets held for the long term and unlikely to be turned into cash for the operation of a business. However, the term is increasingly used (including by tax authorities) to encompass other assets such as stocks. [2]"

capital budget,A plan for long-term spending on capital assets.  There are various capital budgeting methods which include:  net present value (NPV) internal rate of return discounted cashflow payback period 
capital budgeting,"Capital budgeting (also known as investment appraisal) is the process by which a company determines whether projects (such as investing in R&D;, opening a new branch, replacing a machine) are worth pursuing. A project is worth pursuing if it increases the value of the company. A project typically adds value to the company if it earns a rate of return that exceeds the cost of capital. The opportunity cost of capital (also known as the hurdle rate) is the expected return that is forgone by investing in the project rather than in comparable financial securities, such as shares, with the same risk as the project under consideration. While capital budgeting is a fairly straightforward process from a conceptual viewpoint, it can be very challenging in practice. Not only is it difficult to determine the group's appropriate cost of capital, it is often even trickier to accurately forecast the incremental cash flows that result from taking on the project. Example A construction company has to decide whether to construct a building for a customer. The construction project requires an upfront outlay of  1m now and will generate a revenue of  1.25m in a year s time when the client pays for the completed building. The expected return on investment is ( 1.25m -  1m)/ 1 million   0.25 or 25 per cent a year. The return on the project now has to be compared with the company's cost of capital. Instead of investing in the project, the group could buy, for example, bonds or shares in another construction company. The return that could be achieved from investing in these securities represents the company s opportunity cost of capital, assuming the return on this portfolio of securities has the same risk profile as the project. If the opportunity cost of capital is less than 25 per cent, then the company should accept the project, and if it is less, then it should accept. Clearly, if the company could earn 30 per cent in the financial market for a similar risk level, then it makes no sense to invest in a project that only offers 25 per cent. The net present value added to the company from taking on the project can be found by discounting the project s incremental cash flows at the opportunity cost of capital. Assuming a cost of capital of 20 per cent, the project s net present value for the above example is:  1 million +  1.25 million/(1+0.2)    41667 Note that future cash flows are discounted at a rate of 20 per cent to reflect the time value of money: a pound today is worth more than a pound in a year s time. [1]"

capital employed,"The total amount of share capital and debt that a company has and uses. [1] There are a number of inter-related definitions, but the one most commonly cited is: total assets less current liabilities, or non-current assets plus working capital. Capital employed is the value of the assets that contribute to a company s ability to generate revenue. [2] "
capital equipment,"Machinery, tools, vehicles, etc. used to generate a finished product or service."
capital expenditure/spending,"Capital expenditures or capex are investments in assets that will have a long life such as property, plant, and equipment. In accounting terms, the money spent will not run through the income statement directly but will appear on the cash flow statement. Capital investments will be depreciated and the depreciation expense will run through the income statement over multiple periods. Capex differs from revenue expenditure, which in accounting terms is used to cover repair and maintenance charges that do not enhance a company's earning capacity. For example, a company might repair a piece of machinery at a factory, but it will not result in the machine producing any more goods.   capex in the news In September 2013, an FT Alphaville blog considered the mismatch between cash flow in the US, the UK, the euro area and Japan and their capital expenditure. At 8.1 per cent of GDP, the writer noted, capex in those areas was still below the trough set in the 2001/2002 recession."

capital formation,The accumulation of wealth for the purpose of investing in capital goods.
capital gain,"The profit made on the sale of an asset (i.e. when the sale price is higher than the purchase price). The opposite is a capital loss. A capital gain or loss is unrealised until a sale occurs, at which point the gain/loss is realised. Many countries impose a tax on capital gains (capital gains tax)."
capital gains distribution,"Investment companies are vehicles in which investors pool their monies into a common portfolio. The most common type of investment company is the open-end investment company, otherwise known as a mutual fund. Mutual funds operate as pass-through entities. This means that any income they earn is passed through to investors after payment of operating expenses. As pass-through entities, the nature of the income is also passed through to the investors. Hence, dividend income is distributed as dividend income and interest income is distributed as interest income. The investors then declare this income as their taxable to themselves. Most investment companies will make trades during the year, and as a result generate capital gains and capital losses. Some of these are classified as short-term and the rest are classified as long-term. At least once each year, mutual funds must compute their net short-term capital gains and their net long-term capital gains, and distribute these gains to the shareholders. These distributions are referred to as capital gains distributions. In some cases, these distributions may be declared at the end of the calendar year, and paid in January. This is one of the few situations in which a person would declare as taxable income in one year money received in the following year. The holding period is based on how long the fund has held a security, not how long the investor has owned shares in a fund. Thus, a person may have just bought a fund and still receive a long-term capital gain distribution, or a person may have held a fund for many years, and still receive a short-term capital gain distribution. [1]"
capital gains tax CGT,"A tax on chargeable gains of individuals, trustees and personal representatives of deceased persons. Broadly, the net gain on an asset is calculated by reference to the difference between the sales proceeds and the acquisition cost. CGT is payable at different rates for basic rate, and higher and additional rate taxpayers. The rate that applies to higher and additional rate taxpayers also applies to trustees, personal representatives of deceased persons and those who pay the  50,000 remittance basis charge regardless of their income levels. Taxpayers are not liable to CGT if net capital gains after both current and brought forward losses for any tax year do not exceed the annual exempt amount for the year. In addition, there are various reliefs and exemptions available, including entrepreneurs  relief. Companies are not subject to capital gains tax, but are liable to corporation tax on their chargeable gains on the same principles as for CGT (but with certain significant differences). A company pays tax on its chargeable gains at its marginal rate of tax. Companies are not entitled to an annual exempt amount or to certain other reliefs including entrepreneur s relief. However, in calculating the chargeable gain subject to tax, companies are entitled to an indexation allowance, based on RPI inflation, which can reduce the gain depending on how long the asset has been held. Where a residential property that has been subject to the annual tax on enveloped dwellings (ATED) is disposed of, there will be a 28% capital gains tax charge on the non-natural person (e.g. company) making the disposal. See also private residence relief [1]   capital gains tax in the news In 2015, an FT reporter wrote that partners in British-based private equity firms are likely to face higher tax bills after the Treasury said it would apply the full rate of capital gains to deal profits. The Treasury said it would immediately prevent managers using  tax loopholes  to reduce the amount of tax they paid. The changes revolve around  carried interest , the 20 per cent share of deal profits that private equity executives receive on deals after their investors. Historically, this has been classed as a capital gain and taxed at a lower rate than income. The government said it still  considers that carried interest should be subject to CGT, as it reflects the underlying long term performance of a fund s investments.  [2]"
capital gearing,See gearing.
capital goods,"Goods used to produce other goods. This is basically fixed assets such as machinery, buildings, etc, although the term can also encompass roads, train lines and other economic infrastructure.

The securities might be issued by a company which could issue shares or bonds to raise money. Bonds could also be issued by other entitiies in need of long-term cash, such as regional or national governments. The securities are issued in what is known as the primary market and traded in the secondary market. In the primary market a company would have face to face meetings to place its securities with investors. A company might work with an investment bank who would act as an intermediary and underwrite the offering.                                  In the secondary market the original investors can sell the securities they have just bought. The trading of the securities is opened up to all the participants in a particular market. Short-term funds are raised in the money markets.     capital markets in the news In September 2013, Jamie Dimon, the JP Morgan chief executive, told staff he was simplifying the bank's structure in response to the regulatory probes.

"capital, capital, capital","The reform strategy of US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner (2009) focused on requiring banks to hold bigger buffers against losses, hence he is associated with the mantra that  capital, capital, capital  is the way to prevent future financial crises. This approach has three main weaknesses.  First, it relies on the international Basel negotiations to raise capital requirements.  Powerful countries, such as Germany and France, are opposed to significantly strengthening capital.   Second, the details of implementing capital requirements are left to regulators; in the past, banks have found it easy to lobby for lax rules.   Third, even if capital requirements are raised for banks, this will tend to push financial transactions (and the weight of balance sheet risk) towards the relatively unregulated shadow banking system. It remains to be seen exactly how this strategy dovetails with the existence and expansive mandate (on paper) of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. [1]"

carbon capture,"Also known as carbon storage or carbon sequestration. Carbon dioxide gas is recovered from the burning of fossil fuels, liquefied and pumped at pressure underground where it can be securely stored for very long periods.  [1]"
carbon credit,"The United Nations' Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) scheme awards tradeable carbon credits to projects that reduce developing countries  greenhouse gas emissions   such as wind farms, solar power, or the capture of methane. Each carbon credit, known as a Certified Emission Reduction (CER), represents a tonne of carbon dioxide, or equivalent for other greenhouse gases, which is not emitted. In order to be awarded credits, project developers  plans must be approved by the mechanism s executive board, which has drawn up strict methodologies that projects must adhere to. Credits  prices are determined by the market. They are volatile and currently sell for about $10 to $15. The price is heavily influenced by the European Union s emissions trading scheme because companies can also buy CDM credits to fulfil their quotas.  [1]"
carbon dioxide equivalent,"Some greenhouse gases have a much more pronounced effect on the climate than others: methane, for instance, has more than 20 times the warming effect of carbon dioxide. So the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, made up of methane, carbon dioxide and other gases, is usually measured in terms of carbon dioxide, partly to make it easier to reckon their overall effect, and partly because some of the gases degrade into carbon dioxide over time. Carbon dioxide can linger in the atmosphere for about a hundred years. [1]"
carbon footprint,"The estimated climate change impact of something, such as a product or service or a company's operations. It is common shorthand for accounting for all greenhouse gases. Using the example of plastic, so-called  indirect  emissions, such as extracting oil to make the plastic, need to be traced back and included alongside direct emissions, such as producing something with the plastic. Claiming carbon-neutrality when not accounting for all potential costs can be seen as 'public relations'. Any footprint calculation is an estimate, based on more or less reliable data   so figures need treating with caution and discernment.  As ever, we notice and value what we measure, so may ignore and devalue vital intangibles we cannot measure such as biodiversity and its loss.  Despite challenges, trying to count carbon impacts focuses attention, and might help us develop 'a carbon instinct' (Berners-Lee, M. How bad are bananas  The carbon footprint of everything, 2010,  p.xi), and thus direct our efforts where we might have greater effects. When organisations take on the task of carbon footprinting, often change is progressive. It is a learning process, with the aim being successively lower impacts. Developing carbon-consciousness helps individuals and companies make strategic choices, and influences daily practices.[1] Example You could calculate the relative carbon footprints of people travelling by train or plane to a meeting, or of video-conferencing instead.  Costs of accommodation, meals and other impacts would need to be taken into account.    See Article: Deal expected to reduce carbon emissions Article: Local initiatives: Cities take big steps to trim carbon footprints"
carbon market,"A market that is created from the trading of carbon emission allowances to encourage or help countries and companies to limit their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.  This is also known as emissions or carbon trading. Carbon emissions trading is a way of reducing greenhouse gases produced by polluters. E.g., in the EU, it operates on a cap and trade system where a limit (cap) is set on C02 emissions and permits are given to emitters to release a certain amount of CO2.  If a company exceeds its allowance, it has to purchase additional permits to cover the excess.  If a company does not exceed its limit, then it can sell their unused allowances. [1] Please note that this system does not take account of the wider market in carbon under the Kyoto protocol, which operates differently. [2] ExampleIn August 2012, the EU and Australia have agreed to link their carbon markets in a move that both sides hope will lay the foundation for a global trading system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Brussels is trying to accelerate that process by opening talks with South Korea, China and the state of California   where carbon markets are in various states of development   about possible forms of collaboration. News of the Australia link sparked a short-lived rally in EU carbon permits, with prices jumping nearly 4 per cent as some traders anticipated a fresh source of demand, but those gains later evaporated. Each permit gives factories, airlines and other holders the right to emit a tonne of carbon each year without penalty.

carbon neutral,"Companies usually achieve carbon-neutral status by cutting greenhouse gas emissions, investing in renewable energy and using other resources more sparingly.

carbon price floor,"A carbon price floor came into effect on 1 April 2013. The carbon price floor taxes fossil fuels (solid fuels, gas and LPG) used in electricity generation under climate change levy (CCL) and fuel duty. These fossil fuels are subject to a  carbon price support rate  based on carbon content which will create in essence a carbon price floor. As oil used in electricity generation is not subject to CCL, the fuel duty which can be reclaimed will be subject to a restriction in order to create the same effect. [1]"
carbon tax,This is a direct tax on greenhouse gas emissions to encourage companies to curb their emissions and protect the environment. To reach an emissions target through taxation requires a careful calibration of the tax level.

carry trade,"A carry trade is a strategy in which an investor borrows money at a low interest rate in order to invest in an asset that is likely to provide a higher return. This strategy is very common in the foreign exchange market. For example, in the period up to 2007 many investors borrowed in Japanese yen or Swiss francs, taking advantage of very low interest rates in Japan and Switzerland, and used the money to take long positions in currencies backed by high interest rates, such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars and South African rand. This strategy relies on relative stability in asset prices, as an adverse exchange rate movement can easily wipe out the returns from the underlying interest rate differential. This leads some to refer to the carry trade as akin to picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.The yen carry trade reversed sharply in 2007 as global interest rate differentials narrowed, causing the yen to rally against currencies such as the antipodean dollars.

In contrast to a balance sheet statement, which gives a snapshot of a company's assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity at a given moment in time, a cash flow statement shows inflows and outflows over a given period of time. The bottom line of a cash flow statement shows the net increase or decrease in cash for the period. In general, cash flow statements are divided into three main parts which show flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.

chaebol,"Chaebol is a family-run conglomerate in South Korea. Such groups have been at the heart of its rapid industrial development over many years, and tower over almost every area of business: from stockbroking to theme parks; from supermarkets to heavy weapons. [1] ExampleSamsung, which began as a small noodle business in 1938, is now a behemoth. Companies linked to the group, of which Samsung Electronics is just one, make up about a quarter of the Kospi share index. There s Samsung Heavy, which builds oil tankers, Samsung Everland, which runs a theme park and a zoo, and Samsung Life Insurance, which can presumably insure you against the possibility of being mauled by one of Samsung Everland s lions. [2] By 2012, this group is the largest chaebol which accounts for about a fifth of South Korea s exports. While the global success of chaebol like Samsung, and Hyundai, motor company, has boosted South Korea s standing abroad, at home their economic dominance has prompted concerns that they have developed a near-monopoly on the country s most talented workers, while restricting the prospects of the small companies that supply and compete with them. [3]Some Koreans blame chaebol for exacerbating the wealth gap by squeezing suppliers too hard. South Korea s Fair Trade Commission says their dominance also harms consumers. In 2010 it found 3,500 cases of price-fixing. Daniel Tudor, author of Korea: The Impossible Country, a forthcoming book, compares chaebol to tall trees beneath whose canopy nothing else can grow. Enormous conglomerates were nurtured as national champions under the dictatorship of Park Chung-hee, who ruled until 1979. That helped South Korea s warp-speed development. But, Mr Tudor argues, that  a totally chaebol-dominated economy  is no longer suited to a country with higher per capita wealth than the European average on a purchasing power parity basis.

cheap money,"The term cheap money refers to borrowers' ability to access funds at low interest rates. The availability of cheap money is blamed for the huge accumulation of debt at both national and household levels in developed countries. As those same countries struggled to extricate themselves from recession following the financial crisis of 2007-2008 their central banks adopted measures, including quantitative easing, that would make more cheap money available in the hope that it would stimulate lending as a means of boosting the economy.   cheap money in the news Despite criticism of the policy of creating more  cheap money, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, argued in February 2013 that although a prolonged period of low interest rates could damage financial stability, low interest rates also served to reduce risk in the system by encouraging firms to rely on longer term funding. Cheap money would also make it easier to service existing debt. Meanwhile, at the beginning of March 2013 a Bank of England scheme to pump  100bn into households and businesses, the Funding for Lending Scheme, appeared to be having little effect."

child allowance,The old name for child benefit. [1] 
child benefit,"Money provided by the UK government to parents of children who have not yet reached 16, or 19 if they remain in full-time education.   child benefit in the news On January 7 2013, the UK government removed the previously universal child benefit from families where one or more parents were classified as a higher earner. The change affects any household with children with a parent earning more than  50,000. A taper applies to the benefit so that the benefit will be taken away completely once earnings hit  60,000 after approved pensions deductions. The new policy will see hundreds of thousands of parents forced into the self-assessment tax system. It was also criticised because a household with two parents each earning just under  50,000 would keep all their benefit, while a single parent earning more than  60,000 would lose all of his/her child benefit. View: PM defends child benefit charges"
child benefit higher income tax charge,"Child benefit, which historically had been a universal benefit, is now withdrawn gradually from higher earners. This is done through an income tax charge and applies to any household where a member of that household has an annual income over  50,000. The benefit is withdrawn at 1% for every  100 earned over  50,000 and so those earning  60,000 or more lose the benefit altogether. [1]"

child tax credit,"A credit available from April 2003 which consolidated the previous income-related child benefits into a single tax credit. It replaced the child elements of Income Support, the Job Seeker's Allowance, the Working Families' Tax Credit and the Disabled Person's Tax Credit, and also the Children's Tax Credit (CTC) (which was an allowance given in determining taxable income, rather than a benefit payable by the Government). It is payable to the main carer of the child, usually the mother. The tax credit is available whether or not the recipient is working. The amount is reduced as income increases. The Government confirmed in the 2011 Budget that changes are to be made to the tax credits system, including reducing eligibility to those families on higher incomes, with effect from April 2011. [1]"
child trust fund,"All children born between 1 September 2002 and 2 January 2011 were entitled to a Child Trust Fund (CTF). The Government provided an initial endowment of  250 at birth ( 500 for children from low-income families who also qualify for the full Child Tax Credit). A further payment was made when the child reached the age of seven, (again of  250, or  500 for children from low-income families). Parents, other family members and friends are allowed to make additional contributions to the fund. Tax is not payable on income or gains within a CTF. The assets of the fund will be accessible without restriction when the child reaches 18 years of age. The then Coalition Government phased out payments to CTFs, with the last contributions being made in April 2011. Following an announcement in the June 2010 Budget, the Government first reduced its contributions to CTFs and then stopped these contributions altogether. It is still possible for parents and others to make contributions into existing CTFs, but no new CTFs can be created for children born on or after 3 January 2011. Instead, Junior ISAs are available for these children. From April 2015, cash in a CTF can be transferred to a Junior ISA [1]"

choke price,"The choke price is reached when the price rises high enough that demand for that item (or commodity   the term is often used in commodities trading) reaches zero. The choke price is the exact point at which demand ceases. Buyers are also not interested in anything with a higher price, but the choke price is the lowest for which there is zero demand. The choke price is used in demand and supply analysis.   choke price in the news In December 2012 a writer for FT Alphaville noted the effect of quantitative easing on gold's choke price. She pointed out that in 2011 that a flattening curve in spot gold suggested that a choke price was about to be reached and that until it was reached people would continue to want to buy and hoard gold. However, new expectations of higher interest rates in the US led to renewed buying interest in gold and shifted the choke price temporarily higher."
churn,"The number of customers who stop buying a service from a supplier in a particular period of time, either because they stop using the service or because they change to another supplier. [1] "
churn rate,"Churn rate is a marketing term for the rate at which a company loses customers for a product or service that depends on repeat sales or regular customer usage. Churn rate can also be used to refer to the frequency of deals by a particular broker on behalf of a particular client.   churn rate in the news In June 2013 a Lex note on a possible tie up between Vodafone and Kabel Deutschland commented that there could be room for future synergies.  It was there could be future cross-selling opportunities and scope for reducing customer churn (lower with bundled packages).  A high churn rate could also be interpreted as a desirable outcome, for example in the UK domestic energy supplier market. A report in June 2013 commented on Ofgem's discovery in 2008 that liquidity in the UK electricity market was lower than other energy and commodity markets, with relatively low  churn    the ratio of a commodity s traded volume to its physical consumption. Ofgem says the churn rate continued to decline last year, a sign, it said, that the market was failing to meet the needs of participants."

circular economy,"A circular economy should see a departure from the current ""take, make and dispose"" approach that underlines much of modern civilisation. Instead, in the circular economy model, durable goods would be designed so that they could be repaired rather than replaced and biological materials would be managed so that they could be returned to the biosphere without contamination.  During 2013, the World Economic Forum in partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation   with the support of McKinsey & Company   engaged in conversations with key business leaders and experts to identify the relevant trigger points for scaling up this new model.  Towards the Circular Economy: Accelerating the scale-up across global supply chains,  launched in the Forum s 2014 Annual Meeting in Davos, describes the results of this research and lays out a plan of action.  The report highlights the need for more circular flows of major global raw materials, such as polymers, steel and glass. This would be a decisive step in itself, allowing re-used and virgin materials to become interchangeable. This opens up the economic potential of the circular model   in some cases leading to 40-50% savings - and moves away from today s  recycling  which generally downgrades materials, leading to eventual waste and continuing high demand for virgin materials.   Circular economy in the news In November 2013 an FT report reported on the latest universities to join the circular management movement and commit to helping redesign the world's economy on the principles of circular management. Tongji in China and MIT in the US joined Yale, Stanford and Berkeley in the US and London Business School, Imperial College and Cranfield in the UK.               "

classical economics,"A school of economic thought, exemplified by Adam Smith's writings in the 18th century, that states that a change in supply will eventually be matched by a change in demand - so that the economy is always moving towards equilibrium. Overtaken first by neo-classical economics in the early 20th century, it was then overtaken by Keynesian thought in the 1920s and 1930s. The re-emergence in the late 20th century of policies aimed at minimising government intervention in the economy, including efforts towards free trade, was backed to some extent by principles related to classical economics. [1] The term classical economics was first used by Karl Marx (1818   1883) to describe early economists like Adam Smith (1723   1790), David Ricardo (1772   1823), John Stuart Mill (1806   1873) and Thomas Robert Malthus (1766   1834). Most important is Smith s work An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776) because it marks the starting point of economics as a science. Still today, Smith s concept of the  invisible hand  shapes our understanding of the market economy. It is interpreted as the work of the price mechanism bringing together supply and demand in a market. The result is that the market economy simultaneously maximises the benefits for consumers and firms. Furthermore, his promotion of the  laissez-faire  concept   where economic performance is optimised when there is limited government interference   opened the door for free trade and a proper role for governments. In terms of trade, the concept means no protectionism. In terms of the role of the government, the  laissez-faire  approach advocates setting up and enforcing a legal system that protects free markets and competition. ExampleDavid Ricardo s concept of comparative advantage between countries in international trade, for example, is one theory from classical economics that is still applied today. It states that a country should produce for export goods and services whose production costs are lower than that of other goods. Ricardo makes his famous example of England and Portugal both producing wine and cloth, but at lower costs in Portugal than in England. Consequently, Portugal has an absolute advantage in trade. However, it makes sense for both countries to trade. England should focus on the production of cloth and Portugal on wine, because these are the products where both countries have a comparative advantage. That is, Portugal s production cost for wine is lower than for cloth and in England it is the other way around. For example, with the wine produced, Portugal can buy more cloth through trade than if it used its resources to produce the cloth. The same is true for England . It will get more wine in exchange for cloth, compared to a situation in which it produces its own wine. [2]"

In a CCA, any amount a fund company pays above trade execution is put into a pool to pay the broker for research. [1]"

climate change,"Scientists have understood since the 19th century that the earth s climate might be changed by an increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, and similar gases, trap infra red radiation on earth that would otherwise dissipate into space. This is known as the  greenhouse effect  and the gases as  greenhouse gases . As burning fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas - on which modern economies rely - produces carbon dioxide in large quantities, this colourless, odourless and otherwise harmless gas has been identified as potentially dangerous to the environment. What are the effects of climate change  A little heating of the earth might not sound very dangerous. However, scientists now understand that heating the earth has other effects too. An increase in extreme weather, such as storms, droughts, floods and heatwaves can also result. Some areas grow drier, turning into deserts, while others grow wetter. Ice in the Arctic and Antarctic and glaciers on mountain tops may also melt, and this could push up the sea level. There is also a small risk of very extreme events: for instance, some scientists have posited that the Gulf Stream weather system that warms Europe could change direction under the influence of melting ice from the Arctic, which would have a drastic effect on Europe s weather.

climate change levy,"The climate change levy is charged on electricity, coal (including hydrocarbon derivatives) and natural/petroleum gas supplied to industrial and commercial consumers. Suppliers are required to register and collect the tax. The levy is calculated at different rates for different fuels. [1]   climate change levy in the news In the UK Summer Budget 2015 speech, the chancellor said the government would remove the climate change levy exemption for renewably sourced electricity from 1st of August 2015. Drax, the power utility switching from burning coal to wood pellets, said the move, which is estimated to save  450m in the current financial year and  900m by 2020, could reduce its revenues by about  30m in 2015 and  60m in 2016.  We are surprised and disappointed at this retrospective change to a support regime which has been in place since 2001 specifically to encourage green energy and support renewable investment decisions,  said the chief executive of Drax.

cluster,"A  cluster  is a geographically concentrated group of companies and institutions in a particular field. Their activities are closely related and complementary to each other, all contributing to the elevation of the productivity, innovation, and competitiveness of its members. The companies involved include upstream and downstream buyers as well as suppliers and producers. Institutions, on the other hand, are often financial services, research outfits and universities, trade associations and governments.   Example of the term  cluster  in use The Dutch flower cluster contains different establishments to ensure that it remains the world leader in the growing and selling of flowers. These establishments range from auction houses, flower growers, special equipment suppliers for growing and preserving flowers, specialised logistic companies, universities and research institutes, as well as specialised financial services and dedicated governmental agencies.[1]"
cluster analysis,The process of studying things in order to find groups that have characteristics in common. [1] 
cluster theory,"A cluster consists of groups of associated and interconnected proximate firms that are linked vertically and/or horizontally through their commonalities and complementariness in products, services, inputs, technologies or outputs activities. The presence of leading financial centres on the world map suggests that much of competitive advantage lies outside a given company or even outside its industry, residing instead in the location of its business units. Cluster theory argues that co-location with other firms does not imply clustering when associated benefits like prolific innovation, increase in productivity, and/or the presence of externalities cannot be demonstrated. Research reveals that strong clusters generally tend to attract more firms, and clusters with strong innovative records have an advantage in achieving more innovation and higher productivity; these are self-fulfilling and path-dependent. While cluster theory includes strands on the types of externalities, linkages, heightened demand, productivity and innovation, one key tenet is path dependency. Positive feedback is seen to be playing a central role in clusters. Firstly, research has shown that the growth of incumbents and new entrants increase the intensity of clustering and can support further growth and attract even more entrants. Secondly, this path dependency will not remain positive indefinitely once the cluster reaches a critical mass.  Beyond some saturation point, congestion and competition might slowdown the cluster, and eventually possibly contribute to the decline of the cluster. The theory suggests that externalities that initially draw firms together into clusters could eventually erode due to congestion and competition.   A life cycle in clusters is now evident, where cluster formation, growth and decline are set against the background of an industry life cycle. This is put forth by Kuah and Ward (2011) in the UK financial services.* The findings suggest that established and older institutions in a cluster (for example in the City of London) may not benefit from congestion signified by localisation externalities or more competitors. Newer and smaller institutions in a cluster, however, have a greater reliance on such spill-over effects and supporting inputs from other financial institutions around. This is a more complex appreciation of clustering. It provide evidence that clusters do have a lifecycle and is more helpful than the simple assumption that bigger clusters are always positive for incumbents.[1] *Kuah, A.T.H.

clutter,When there is so much information available that people cannot easily understand or remember it. [1] 
co-competence,"Co-competence involves the possession of both transactional and relational competences. Transactional competence refers to a company s distinctive capabilities and strengths grounded in economic efficiency (such as innovation, quality, customer responsiveness and productivity). Relational competence refers to a company's distinctive capabilities and strengths in cultivating, maintaining and exploiting beneficial relationships with its external business stakeholders, such as partners, competitors, governments, suppliers and distributors. Firms excelling in both transactional and relational competencies tend to outperform others in creating, leveraging and upgrading collaborative competitive advantages. In many foreign markets, such as Asia, relational competence is profoundly important as business transactions are often based on interpersonal and interorganisational connections. Example To compete with groups such as GE, ABB, Siemens, Westinghouse and Mitsubishi in the power equipment industry, Harbin Power Equipment Corporate (HPEC) has actively expanded internationally, especially in developing countries where the company can leverage its relational competence developed at home - in particularlar rich experience in dealing with governments and institutional hardship. HPEC has developed and leveraged its strong and healthy ties with local officials in host countries, such as Pakistan, Vietnam and Sudan, to facilitate project completion and related economic activities. Meanwhile, HPEC s technology is more suitable to the level these developing countries can accept, absorb and assimilate than its western counterparts. Its transactional competence is also reflected in cost advantage. HPEC wins engineering and power equipment orders in Indonesia, Vietnam and India by quoting very attractive prices (often 10 per cent lower) compared to their European and American rivals.[1]"
co-creation,"Co-creation is the process by which groups of people from across boundaries come together with a shared purpose to create value through improving or developing services and products. A particular feature of co-creation is boundary spanning cooperation.  For instance, this process can span across functions, businesses or customers of the company. [1] ViewStakeholder dreams and shareholder"
co-evolution,"A company's efforts to simultaneously adapt to and influence the external environment. Co-evolution is the joint and interactive outcome of managerial intentionality, organisational efforts and environmental change. It considers organisations, their populations and their environments as the interdependent outcome of managerial actions, institutional influences and extra-institutional changes (technological, sociopolitical and other environmental phenomena). Co-evolution assumes that organisational and environmental changes occur in a simultaneous and interactive manner. Thus, strategy is not merely a passive response but rather a proactive intention to change both task and institutional environments facing the firm. Organisational and environmental changes are bi-directional, interactional and mutually influencing and evolving. Organisations and their parts, both internal and external (such as regulators, suppliers, competitors or partners), co-evolve with each other and with a changing environment. Example Mexico s Cemex, the world s top building solution company, has worked with the UK government through publishing sustainable development reports since 2007. Construction in the UK is highly regulated by the government, requiring foreign companies to operate under high standards concerning environment, quality, and safety. While Cemex works with the UK government to ensure such standard compliance, its executives also regularly meet UK officials in an effort to create a cost-effective environment that stimulates the entire industry s international competitiveness.[1] "
co-insurance,When two or more insurers share a particular risk. [1] 
co-location,"In a sign of the rush for speed in trading, ex changes are building huge data centres where traders, members and non-members alike, can place computers containing their trading algorithms next to an exchange s matching engine, which matches  buy  and  sell  orders. This  co-location  shaves crucial milliseconds from the time it takes to complete a trade. [1] If traders are located 100 miles away from an exchange, they face a delay of one millisecond whenever they seek to trade a price via their computer screen. Few serious investors can afford to be that late to prices that flash so quickly. The blink of a human eye takes 300 milliseconds; many traders now operate in the smaller realm of microseconds. Being faster than rivals to the best price   that is, having the lowest  latency    is thus crucial in today s markets. [2] ExampleNYSE Euronext is spending $500m to build two centres, one in New Jersey, another in Essex, England, each larger than two soccer pitches. Specialist companies also operate such co-location centres   including Nasdaq-listed Equinix, which expanded in Germany.

co-opetition,"Simultaneous competition and co-operation between a company and external players such as rivals, government agencies, suppliers, distributors, and partners. Co-opetition goes beyond competition and co-operation, combining the advantages of both. It develops win-win scenarios in which a business strives to gain more, not necessarily by taking market share or profit from a contender, but by creating a bigger market in complementary areas. Companies often work with selected rivals, suppliers, distributors or alliance partners to collectively enhance performance by sharing complementary resources and committing to common goals (such as improving industry standards, research and development, and consumer or market awareness). At the same time, they compete by taking independent action in other areas (such as product quality, market share, sales growth and cost effectiveness). In general, co-opetition arises due to growing interdependence between businesses as well as increasing demand for strategic flexibility and collective action in certain areas or functions. Example Siemens AG and Motorola jointly developed the world s first 300mm wafer (semiconductor) production facility in Dresden, Germany. The two companies also work together on automation and control, communication networks, mobile communication, and information technology. [1]"

They carry a distinct accounting advantage as unlike other kinds of convertible bonds, they do not have to be included in a company's diluted earnings per share until the bonds are eligible for conversion. [1] It is also a form of capital that regulators hope could help buttress a bank s finances in times of stress. CoCos are different to existing hybrids because they are designed to convert into shares if a pre-set trigger is breached in order to provide a shock boost to capital levels and reassure investors more generally.Hybrids, including CoCos, contain features of both debt and equity. They are intended to act as a cushion between senior bondholders and shareholders, who will suffer first if capital is lost. The bonds usually allow a bank to either hold on to the capital past the first repayment date, or to skip paying interest coupons on the notes. ExampleIn the case of Lloyds bank, the trigger is if its core tier one capital ratio falls below 5 per cent. Conversion of its CoCos would push the ratio above 6.5 per cent.

coding,"A systematic method for analysing qualitative data and generating deep insights into customers  needs. Coding is a way of identifying categories in the data. For example, videos of customers using products will be coded looking for all the  uses  of a product, the way a product is  misused , and the way customers develop  workarounds  to overcome the limitations of existing products. Further coding will look for  frustration  with existing products,  cultural  issues and other categories that emerge from watching the videos. Applying coding ensures that none of the subtleties of qualitative data are lost and all of the opportunities for innovative new products and services are identified. Codes that market  researchers also look for are the positive and negative emotions generated from using a product. By identifying such emotions, market researchers can gain insights  into what product features are needed or can be improved. Example Coding is a fundamental part of ethnographic market research. Videos of customers (either B2B or B2C) using products are analysed systematically. For example, Bosch Packaging produces production line equipment for the pharmaceutical market. In order to develop a new product, the operation of competitors  equipment was analysed. This included looking for the advantages and limitations of the competitors  equipment, checking when and why operators were frustrated with machines, and where the existing equipment had been modified to overcome problems. Based on these insights, a breakthrough product - the Bosch FXS 5100 used for the processing of presterilized, nested syringes - was designed and has been very successful. [1]"

collateralised mortgage obligation  CMO,"Mortgage-backed bond divided into different classes or tranches of maturity, each paying a different interest rate. Interest payments to CMO holders and redemption of each tranche are directly related to the principal and interest received from the holders of the underlying mortgages and passed into a pool. As money is taken from the pool, each tranche of the CMO is successively redeemed. Popular in the US, CMOs are normally backed by top grade mortgages and are seen as relatively secure investments. A collateralised bond obligation (CBO) is similar in concept, except that the security is made up of bonds of varying credit quality. Each tranche, in this case called a tier, is backed by a different kind of bond - the higher the quality of the collateral, the lower the interest rate, and vice-versa. Typically, the bottom tier is backed by high-risk junk bonds and pays whatever is left in the pool after interest on the higher-quality tiers is paid. See covered bond; mortgage-backed securities."

collective intelligence,"Collective intelligence - or crowdsourcing - refers to harnessing the power of a large number of people to solve a difficult problem as a group. The idea is that a group of people can solve problems efficiently and offer greater insight and a better answer than any one individual could provide. Collective intelligence can also be a valuable marketing tool.  Example David s Bridal, the US bridal chain, employed collective intelligence by inviting brides-to-be to play online games that use photos of new dress styles to test their opinions in order to give an idea of what type of dresses will sell. [1] The games-based predictive system is run by First Insight, a Pittsburgh-based start-up that is part of a broader push in the retail industry to harness the power of collective intelligence. First Insight is similarly trying to bring collective intelligence to bear on the most unpredictable areas of fashion demand forecasting, but on a much larger scale   entering what has traditionally been the domain of the skilled buyers who use a mix of instinct and experience to make their bets.

commercial bank,"This is a financial institution providing services for businesses, organisations and individuals. Services include offering current, deposit and saving accounts as well as giving out loans to businesses. [1] A commercial banks is defined as a bank whose main business is deposit-taking and making loans. This contrasts with an investment bank whose main business is securities underwriting, M&A; advisory, asset management and securities trading. Commercial banks make their profits by taking small, short-term, relatively liquid deposits and transforming these into larger, longer maturity loans. This process of asset transformation generates net income for the commercial bank. Note that many commercial banks do investment banking business although the latter is not considered the main business area. ExampleExamples of commercial banks include HSBC and Bank of America Merill Lynch. [2] A commercial bank is one primarily engaged in deposit and lending activities to private and corporate clients in wholesale and retail banking. Other services typically include bank and credit cards, private banking, custody and guarantees, cash management and settlement as well as trade finance. The term gained prominence as a counterpart to  investment bank  after the introduction of the Glass-Steagall-Act (1933) in the USA that separated capital markets business from deposit taking institutes in the aftermath of the great depression. However, the separation between commercial and investment banking softened more and more during the age of financial liberalisation and globalisation from 1990 to 2007. Banks moved away from low margin deposit and credit business to high margin capital market investments, accompanied with a respective increase in risk. This was backed by politicians and regulators, who increasingly reduced the influence of the state in the overall economy and, in particular, in the financial markets. Eventually the Clinton administration in the USA legalised universal banks, which cover both commercial and investment banking activities with the so-called Gramm-Leach-Bliley-Act in 1999, the basis for the typical business model of banks in continental Europe , which repealed key provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act. After the recent global financial crisis, however, financial regulation has become prominent once again in the US. The Frank-Dodd-Act implemented the Volcker rule in 2010, named after Alan Greenspan s predecessor as president of the US central bank, Fed. The Act bans at least proprietary trading of securities for deposit-taking institutes. [3] "

commercial property equivalent yield,"Equivalent yields are the UK property market s mechanism for communicating the current level of return on commercial property investments. In many other countries this would simply be the relationship between the current rental income from the property after all landlord expenses had been stripped out as a return on the capital value at the beginning of the year; the initial return or yield. Non-UK rents are often fixed under agreements whereby they increase annually often in line with consumer or other price indices so initial yield forms a reliable measure of the relationship between current income and current capital value.  This measure also performs a useful function in other asset markets. But in the UK there are rather more complicated lease structures with rents often fixed for periods of 5 years between rent reviews which are virtually always based on the contentious upwards only provision. In rising or falling markets, the relationship between rent and the actual letting value of the property, the market rent, can start to diverge quite sharply and the initial yield and the reversionary yield (rental value divided into capital value) also widens. Neither of these two measures is deemed to be a reliable indicator as neither of them take any account of the timing and extent of reductions or increases in value at lease expiry or rent review. The solution has been to determine the internal rate of return of the current income to the next rent change and then discount the perpetual current rental value thereafter. This produces a weighted average of the initial and reversionary yields.  It therefore takes no account of any future change in rental values over and above what has already been observed in current markets.  The application to complex lease structures can be difficult and interpretation of these can lead to some variation in the basis of reporting these yields, for example voids on lease expiry, assumptions about frequency of rent payments, etc.  But equivalent yield also forms the mainstay of the main method of market valuation of commercial investment property in the UK. The equivalent yield calculation in its simplest form is: CV           r/y    +      (RV-r)/y (1+y)-t ]  where; CV           current capital value r              current rent under the lease RV           current rental value (or market rent as defined in valuation standards) t              time to next rent change y              the equivalent yield   Example Equivalent yield forms an important measure within the UK s largest property performance measurement system and their precise interpretation within this practice application can be found in the IPD Index Guide.  Current general levels of equivalent yield across the UK property market can be found on the CBRE website. in their UK Rent and Yield Monitor. [1]"
commercial property indices,"Commercial property indices are constructed to measure the performance of commercial investment property and operate in a similar fashion to any other index of asset performance.  Indices can be of both actual properties or constructed from hypothetical properties in different locations. Indices usually produce annual, quarterly or monthly indices of income return, capital value change and total returns, as well as a number of other measures.  Because of the individuality of property assets and the relatively low volume of transactions, commercial property indices are normally valuation rather than transaction based and it is widely held that the low volatility in these indices is caused to some extent by the use of valuations.  Property market indices are a relatively new phenomenon and although they are developing in many countries, many of them have very short histories. A number of property consultants produce market information on commercial property markets and some use valuations of hypothetical modern properties in prime locations to measure value change in markets rather than in specific properties, eliminating the impact of depreciation on these measurements. Example  The indices with the most coverage of actual properties in the UK is the Investment Property Databank (IPD) which produces various measures as indicated above across a number of property types and regional locations. The latest quarterly index (to end of June 2011) was based on properties held mainly by the major property companies and financial institutions to the value of  112.7 billion encompassing over 9,000 properties from 236 separate funds; 50% retail, 30% offices and 15% industrial and 5% other property types."
commercial property investment depreciation,"Depreciation is a well known concept in accounting but is also one of the major characteristics of direct commercial property investment. Properties can depreciate even if their value is actually appreciating.  Property investment depreciation is a relative concept and has been defined as the fall off in value of an existing property relative to a new property in the same location with a modern specification.  Depreciation in both rental and capital values can be arrested by capital improvements and the ultimate cure for depreciation is to redevelop; although major refurbishment can sometimes also create assets that have similar values to new assets. Different commercial properties have different characteristics and therefore different depreciation rates.  Depreciation is ultimately tied to buildings which have a finite life, unlike the land element of any property investment.  The standard high street shop unit in good locations within major cities or towns has a very high land content in its value.  It is not uncommon to see buildings hundreds of years old standing next to modern buildings on the high street and given the uniformity of shop fronts it is hard to even notice the age gap.  Annual depreciation and capital expenditure rates for high street shops are therefore very low.  Offices on the other hand are less location sensitive, have a higher building content relative to land value and have a relatively short life, with high levels of expenditure during that short life. Example Property investment depreciation can be quite difficult to measure due to restrictions in the availability of property market data but there have been a number of studies trying to measure depreciation rates across different commercial property sectors.  This includes a series of studies sponsored by the Investment Property Forum (IPF).  They suggest that the rental value of offices depreciates by very approximately 1% per year against a new building but also need around 1% of the capital value spent each year to keep depreciation down to this rate. [1]"
commercial property market rent,"The concept of market rent in commercial property markets is not straightforward.  It is defined in the Valuations Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, commonly referred to as the Red Book, as  The estimated amount for which a property, or space within a property, should lease (let) on the date of valuation between a willing lessor and a willing lessee on appropriate lease terms in an arm s-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.   Whenever Market Rent is provided the  appropriate lease terms  which it reflects should also be stated  This definition is a global one and appears in the International Valuation Standards commonly known as the White Book (IVSC, GN 2, paragraph 3.1.9.1.) It appears to be the amount that a property would let for in the market place at the date of leasing.  But many rents are not what they seem as, since the property market crash in 1990, landlords have sought to keep the level of rents in the lease contract high.  They can do this by offering tenants lots of incentives at the beginning of the lease such as rent free periods, stepped rents, capital payments, help with fitting out and take-back of existing premises too name a few.  These incentives lead to higher rents being paid after the inducements to let have expired than would be the case if rents had been paid from day one of the lease.  The use of upwards only rent reviews helps support this higher level of rent into the future beyond the first rent review in the lease, typically after 5 years in UK leases. This is why the sentence on appropriate lease terms has been inserted. The rent paid after all incentives such have expired is called the headline rent and the rent that would have been paid had no incentives been given is called the effective rent. Example Current levels of commercial property headline market rents can be found within research and marketing material from many of the major property consultants operating out of the UK such as Jones Lang LaSalle, CBRE, DTZ, Cushman and Wakefield and Savills. Current levels of incentives necessary to support these headline rents are more difficult to identify.  However, there is an annual lease structures review produced by the Investment Property Databank and the British Property Federation identifying the incidence of rent free periods and break clauses within leases amongst other clauses and IPD produce an annual Lease Events Review with Strutt and Parker which identifies whether tenants leave at the end of leases or at breaks and resulting empty periods.

community development finance institutions,"Britain s six largest banks are joining ranks to promote an alternative financing route for small businesses whose credit applications they reject in the latest attempt to ease the funding shortage for these borrowers. The banks have agreed to test a formal referral service to help businesses that fail their own lending criteria to obtain funds from smaller regional lenders known as community development finance institutions (CDFIs). These organisations, which are commonly backed by the government or charities, tend to have a low profile in the UK lending market even though some have large pools of funds they could lend to small and medium-sized enterprises.ExampleSix banks   Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, HSBC, Santander UK and The Co-operative Group   are poised to launch a pilot scheme before the end of 2012 with five of the largest CDFIs around the UK. The banks will not receive any fees for referring businesses in this way.

It could also encourage wary businesses to approach banks for finance. [1] ViewUK banks eye alternative lending for SMEs"
community engagement,"Community engagement is the process of working collaboratively with community groups to address issues that impact the well-being of those groups.  Activities that help firms engage the community include credible and transparent reporting, town hall meetings and collaborative decision making.  Firms that most proactively engage the community often find efficiencies in pushing forward with new projects because they have secured the social license to operate. They often develop the most innovative products and processes because of the need to balance sometimes conflicting points of view, forcing them to think outside the box for new solutions. However, such community engagement activities often take considerable firms' resources and time, but there is widespread agreement for most firms involved in community engagement that such efforts are highly rewarded.  ExampleAnything from the large, such as site locations and environmental impact assessments, to the seemingly inconsequential, such as supporting local schools and financing youth sports teams, that contributes to a  social license to operate.

community investment tax relief,"Community investment tax relief (CITR) is available to individuals and companies that invest in accredited intermediary organisations (Community Development Finance Institutions or CDFIs), which in turn invest in enterprises operating within or for disadvantaged communities. The tax relief reduces the investor's income liable to income tax or corporation tax by up to 25 percent of the sum invested, spread over five years. To obtain maximum relief, investors must hold the investment for at least five years, but if in the course of that period they receive some return of the sum invested they will not necessarily forfeit the relief in full. Reasonable commercial payments of interest and dividends are permitted. There is no limit to the amount of investment on which a single investor may claim relief under the scheme. However, there are limits on the amount of investment that can be raised by any single CDFI. [1]"

competing through logistics,"It is impossible to be outstanding at everything, and supply chain partners need to give priority to capabilities that give each product group its edge in the marketplace. These capabilities define the areas where supply chain partners place priorities on in investment and training, and by focusing innovation and marketing efforts.  The three traditional areas where logistics supports competitive advantage are:  Quality: ensuring that all processes are carried out along the supply chain so that products do what they are supposed to do Speed: survival of the fastest.  Cutting down on the time taken to conduct each process across the supply chain Cost: supporting low prices by efficient manufacture, distribution and servicing  ExampleToday, logistics supports competitiveness in other ways too.  Cutting down on the variability of delivery times reduces the need for buffer stocks.  Dealing with uncertainties like a dock strike or the disruptions to supply caused by earthquakes create logistics challenges.  Thus Toyota UK has developed counter measures for the impact of French dock strikes, whereby shipments from continental suppliers can be rapidly re-routed. [1]"

competitive intelligence,"Competitive intelligence is the process of searching and scanning information through legal and professional practices and analysing and forwarding the valuable information to decision-makers. Competitive intelligence is a way to gain a strategic leverage thanks to the management of information. Having access to the right information at the right moment is considered as a powerful strategic advantage. It can be an inside and discrete activity or a more global and collective project through professional unions or clusters. Competitive intelligence has been largely structured in the past few years. The value of business information has led to the development of specialised consultants. A debate occurred at the occasion of illegal practices of few firms, although it s no longer competitive intelligence but spying and corporate espionage. Example Entering a foreign market, selecting a new partner, managing a merger or acquisition, recruiting a top executive  all these activities should be structured through a competitive intelligence process. For example energy firms such as Total or GDF Suez are famous for their competitive intelligence teams. Competitive intelligence is now a basic part of strategy, marketing and sales analysts' work. In our knowledge economy, the availability of business information is tremendous and routines in scanning the competitive environment definitely worth it. A structured and dynamic process can be rapidly efficient and powerful. [1] See Article: Flights of fancy help replicate real business dilemmas  "
competitive strategy,"A plan that is intended to help a company to get advantages over its competitors, or the process of making this plan. [1] "
competitiveness,"Competitiveness is about boosting the ability to compete by increasing productivity in the long run. It stresses a continual improvement through constant innovation in products, processes and management, which in turn transforms inputs into the valuable products and services that allow a nation to support high wages and achieve attractive returns on capital invested. It consequently creates a strong currency and promotes innovative ways to better use resources. The result is that the standard of living and the prosperity of a nation or society improve. Competitiveness is not to be confused with competition. Competition is more concerned with how a country, region, sector or firm can outflank rivals and gain at their expense. Competition is therefore a zero sum game. Unfortunately, this confusion means that competitiveness is often used to justify state intervention. Reacting to imports of competitive products and services, many countries resort to providing subsidies, which effectively endorse inefficiencies and, more lethally, dampen the innovation central to economic growth as well as suppressing local wages and devaluing their currencies, both of which are akin to selling local labour power on the cheap. True prosperity   and therefore competitiveness   is only created when both companies and governments place innovation and productivity at the centre of their policies and actions.[1]   competitiveness in the news Protectionist policies would seem most likely to damage competitiveness. In April 2013, Pascal Lamy, director-general of the World Trade Organisation spoke about the rising threat of protectionism. An FT editorial commented: ""The belief that protectionism can preserve jobs is an illusion. Shielding a sector from more efficient foreign competitors comes at the expense of other domestic businesses, which are denied access to cheaper goods."""

complementarity,"The term complementarity   derived from the Latin word complere,  to fill up  is used in many disciplines, with different meanings. It found its way into the language of economists in the 19th century. Since the early 1990s, it has gained increased attention in microeconomics, thanks largely to the work of Stanford economists Paul Milgrom, John Roberts and their co-authors. They define complementarity as a relationship between two or more elements such that one element enhances the value of the other one (see John Roberts  book  The Modern Firm ). The notion of complementarity gives greater specificity to the closely related ones of  synergy  and  fit . In the context of organisations, complementarities exist when two or more factors   be they strategic choices, organisational arrangements, capabilities or other such elements   increase each other s effects on performance. For example, Casey Ichniowski, Kathryn Shaw and Giovanna Prennushi showed that particular work practices such as training and flexible job assignments had a greater effect on the productivity of steel finishing lines when they were part of a coherent HR system, than when they were used in isolation. A review of the empirical literature on complementarities by Edgar Ennen and myself has demonstrated that complementarities can be very powerful performance drivers, in particular when they involve many, diverse elements. Complementarity thinking thus goes an important step beyond conventional  best practice  approaches. When many strategic or organisational choices are closely related to one another, seeking to optimise one of them without adapting the others may not yield the hoped-for performance gains, or may even backfire. Complementarities also make imitation by competitors more difficult, thus offering an additional competitive advantage to firms.   Challenges of implementing complementarity strategies The complementarity approach is challenging in that complementarities are often hard to recognise and understand. Mapping a firm s activity system can be a helpful tool in this context. In their article  Can You Say What Your Strategy Is  , David Collis and Michael Rukstad present such an activity system for brokerage firm Edward Jones. Their analysis illustrates how seemingly distinct decisions   such as the choice of investment products, hiring and training policies, and the firm s ownership structure (Edward Jones is a partnership)   directly or indirectly relate to one another. Identifying, developing and nurturing complementarities requires managers to deeply reflect on the nature of their organisations. Following standard recipes is not enough. [1]"

complexity management,"Complexity management, also known as complexity theory, deals with the analysis of complex behaviour in companies. In this context, complexity s foundations are generically called unknowability and unpredictability, in contrast to the quantitative nature of most business disciplines and the consequent measurements of performance. Complexity management seeks to understand nonlinear relationships while looking at the role of self-organisation, emergence, and co-evolution - to name the basic dimensions. This challenges most traditional constructs of management by looking at examples of new paradigms of thought and by proving the fallibility of highly controlled practices, mainly nurtured by what is call the illusion of control. While using systemic thinking and theory as the instruments to map and interpret complexity over time and outside of cause and effect, the success of complexity management in business represents a strategic opportunity that individuals and organisations can cultivate in an increasingly complex business landscape. Example While a company might be obsessed by having control over its own activities, it might not perceive that nascent threats are generated outside of its control, and are therefore unpredictable. Proper use of the complexity thinking mindset would allow organisations to operate comfortably in both market as well as non market conditions, diversifying their scope as well as their research and development efforts.

comply or explain,"The UK Corporate Governance Code (formerly the Combined Code) is primarily a best practice standard of governance for the quality of a company s board leadership, effectiveness, accountability, remuneration process and investor relations. Apart from references to relevant statutory regulations, the code itself has no legal force but it does require a company to comply with the provisions of the code or explain why it has not done so. The  comply or explain  approach recognises that good governance cannot be constrained by ever-increasing statutory regulations which tend towards a  one size fits all  solution. Sometimes, an alternative to following a provision of the code may be justified in particular circumstances. A condition of doing so is that the reasons for it should be explained to shareholders who may wish to discuss the position with the company and whose voting intentions may be influenced as a result The code requires that a company s explanation in its annual report  should aim to illustrate how its actual practices are both consistent with the principle to which the particular provision relates and contribute to good governance.  The principle of  comply or explain  means that companies are accountable to shareholders who can exercise sanctions rather than being accountable to a regulator such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US. Example The UK Financial Reporting Council claims that the   comply or explain   approach is the  trademark of corporate governance in the UK   and is strongly supported by both companies and shareholders. The EU Statutory Audit Directive 2006 now requires all member states to adopt the  comply or explain  approach for its listed companies.[1]"

comprehensive income,"Formally, comprehensive income represents the periodic change in the book value of shareholders  equity during the reporting period resulting from transactions and events not involving owners (i.e., shareholders). (See, for example, Financial Accounting Standards Board, Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No.6). Transactions and events involving owners include issuance and repurchase of shares, and dividend payments; comprehensive income therefore represents the net effect of all other changes in equity and reserves. Comprehensive income is the product of applying the clean surplus model of accounting. Clean surplus accounting simply requires that all changes in shareholders  equity in the period, other than those involving transactions with owners, are reported in income of the period. The result is complete articulation between opening and closing balance sheet values and reported income for the period. Historically, accountants have favoured a narrower definition of income for the purposes of performance reporting. For example, the net income (earnings) figure that management is required to report includes only a subset of the items that constitute comprehensive income. The omitted components of comprehensive (known as dirty surplus flows) were reported in the notes to the financial statements as part of the movement in shareholders  funds. Essentially, these items reflected changes in asset and liability amounts that were accounted for as movements on reserves in the period, rather than as income and expenses (i.e., reserve accounting). Examples of dirty surplus flows include gains and losses arising from translating the financial statements of foreign operations, gains and losses on re-measuring available-for-sale financial assets, changes in the revaluation surplus of property, plant and equipment, and actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension plans. The decision to omit these items from net income is based loosely on the view that they reflect transactions or events that fall beyond the scope of controllable business activities. As a result, their inclusion in periodic income would lead to excessive volatility and a noisier measure of firm performance. The problem with dirty surplus flows is that they can be very large in magnitude. To the extent that significant changes in shareholders  equity are not reflected in periodic net income, there exists scope for confusion on the part of financial statement users if these items are not reported in a transparent manner. Accounting regulators have moved to address this problem by requiring firms to provide information on comprehensive income more prominently. For example, under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), firms are now required to present a Statement of Comprehensive Income which has replaced the traditional income statement. The Statement of Comprehensive Income includes all non-owner changes in shareholders  equity during the reporting period. The move was controversial because bottom-line comprehensive income is much more volatile than the traditional net income figure. As a compromise, IFRS provide management with two reporting options. Option one is a single statement of comprehensive income. Option two involves a two-statement approach whereby management present a statement of net income followed immediately by a second statement of other comprehensive income (i.e., dirty surplus flows).

conceptual framework,"In financial reporting, a conceptual framework is a theory of accounting prepared by a standard-setting body against which practical problems can be tested objectively. A conceptual framework deals with fundamental financial reporting issues such as the objectives and users of financial statements, the characteristics that make accounting information useful, the basic elements of financial statements (e.g., assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses), and the concepts for recognising and measuring these elements in the financial statements. Benefits of a conceptual framework for financial reporting include: establishing precise definitions that facilitate discussion of accounting issues; providing guidance to accounting standard setters when developing and reviewing financial reporting rules; helping to ensure that accounting standards are internally consistent; helping preparers and auditors to resolve financial reporting problems in the absence of an accounting standard; and helping to limit the volume of accounting standards by providing an overarching theory of accounting that can be applied to specific reporting problems.   Example The first conceptual framework for financial reporting was developed in the 1970s by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the US. Since then, most standard-setting bodies in developed economies have sought to develop their own conceptual framework to help guide the standard-setting process. Accordingly, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) developed its own conceptual framework that describes the basic concepts underlying financial statements prepared in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Preparers and auditors cannot ignore the IASB s framework when applying IFRS (see IAS 8 Revised). In September 2010, after working closely with the FASB, the IASB issued a revised version of its conceptual framework (Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting 2010). According to this revised document, the two primary objectives of financial statements prepared under IFRS are economic decision-making and stewardship. The main users of financial statements are considered to be equity investors, lenders and other creditors, while the primary characteristics that make financial reporting information useful to these groups are relevance and faithful representation.

congruence,"The embracing and creation of balance, alignment, integration and transformation as key anchors to the understanding and reframing of who we are, how we think, when we act and what context drives our personal and professional development, versus the compartmentalised contents and processes that drive surviving in corporations.  Congruence building as an approach to personal, organisational, and business systems development is achieved through: - clarity about who we are and what we do - an ability to effectively collaborate with one another - an awareness of the complements in our lives that create effective anchors for risking the development of change - an acceptance for creativity and change - an embracing of personal and professional choices that creates codependency and the desire to make life and work simple - an ability to understand and embrace complexity, which enriches and challenges us to go beyond the known and conscious to the unknown and unconscious to bridge the past, present and future to be fully present in our personal and professional lives.  When organisations follow the direction that allows connectivity to the entrepreneurship that created them, and to their responsibility to their partners - the people - we have congruence in our personal and professional lives, the seventh paradigm. Example When organisations are trying to find a tool of internal alignment, which will lead to an inside out effort and contribution, the congruence development method helps them identify their core capacity that can inspire the emergence into a given market. The congruence model can be used to assess whether a company is ready to make a strategic move, or whether further reflection and alignment is required. [1]"

Companies could be targeted because of something they did (eg, sourcing from suppliers who rely on child labour) or simply because of their association with a certain country or region (eg, Danish companies in the wake of the Muslim cartoon controversy). Targeted companies can fight back, comply or ignore the demands. Example In 2010 Greenpeace organized a campaign encouraging consumers to boycott the Kit Kat chocolate bar brand. Greenpeace alleged that Nestl  sourced palm oil from Indonesian companies that destroyed the rainforest, thereby undermining the habitat of orang-utans. The campaign singled out one major offender, Sinar Mas. One of Greenpeace s most effective tools was a parody of a Kit Kat break commercial posted on YouTube asking Nestl  to give the rainforest a break.

These include items such as food, soft drinks and toiletries, but also lower end consumer electronics goods, such as the cheaper mobile phones and MP3 players.   Consumer packaged goods (CPG) in the news At the end of 2012 research concluded that ""Millennials"" (those born between 1982 and 2003) were supposedly more focused on happiness and less worried about being rich, looking good and being famous. This change in attitude posed a marketing challenge to consumer packaged goods companies. In March 2013, a report looked at the expansion of developed world consumer brands into Africa. Bain consultancy estimated that 70 per cent of consumer packaged goods makers were present in the African market. In October 2013 a report on Coca-Cola said it had been susceptible to the widespread consumer issues that had been referenced by other multinational consumer packaged goods companies, notably slowing growth in many emerging market territories.

consumer price index,"The consumer price index (CPI) and the retail price index (RPI) are both measures of the price of goods and services used to estimate inflation. There are international standards set for inflation measures and the CPI complies with the European standards, while RPI does not.  The main differences are that the CPI uses a basic calculation method seen as superior, but it does not measure the cost of owner-occupied housing. In March 2013 a new measure CPIH will include estimates for the cost of owner-occupied housing using private rent levels as a proxy, while the RPI uses average mortgage interest payments to estimate the costs of home ownership. The CPI is inclusive of VAT, and other taxes, and as such can change as a result of changes in taxation levels.   The UK government's stated policy is to use the consumer price index (CPI) for the indexation of benefits, tax credits and public service pensions, whereas it would use the retail price index (RPI) for the uprating of index-linked gilts and revalorisation of excise duties.   Consumer price index (CPI) in the news  In 2011, the UK government controversially decided to switch from the retail price index (RPI) to the consumer price index (CPI) for the uprating of benefits and  public sector pensions. Unions argued that this was because CPI was consistently lower than RPI. In March 2012, Qinetiq, the privatised UK defence technology contractor, was permitted by a High Court ruling to retroactively apply a switch from RPI indexation to CPI indexation for its pension schemes.[1]"

contango,"When the price of a spot or near-term contract is lower than the price for forward deliveries. This is quite normal, as you would expect the futures price to be higher because of carrying costs, including interest  rates, storage fees and insurance charges. The reverse situation, when spot prices are higher than futures prices, is called backwardation.   contango in the news In October 2011 an FT columnist examined new rules in the US to limit positions in commodities futures. He said banks and many academics argue futures prices do not affect spot prices, which they say are determined by supply and demand plus changes in inventories. However, the writer pointed out that buying of futures pushes up futures prices, thereby increasing contango.  In May 2013 an FT report investigated increased pressure on trading margins for commodities traders. Instead of being in contango, spot oil prices were higher than forward contracts, a situation known as backwardation. The article noted that contango is much more favourable because it allows traders to buy crude oil cheap and store it while locking in future prices. "
content marketing,"Content marketing is the creation of good marketing material around a product, idea or service      with the objective that the content will attract consumers who will then engage in a transaction with the company.

Blogging, tweeting, creating videos and posting to a website with a clear strategy are all types of content marketing. Often the content is geared towards helping or entertaining the audience, and it is frequently produced by external experts.

contingent capital,"Contingent capital is debt that converts into equity when there is a crisis or when certain triggers are met.  [1] Regulators have made no secret of their fondness for contingent capital - it keeps down the cost of capital in the short term, by classifying it as debt, but provides a buffer in case of emergencies that can be switched into loss-absorbing equity. ExampleAlthough most contingent capital will be debt that converts, in extreme circumstances, into equity, i.e., so called contingent convertible bonds or Cocos.  There are other kinds of contingent capital, e.g., the equity that the Royal Bank of Scotland can raise from the government in times of stress.

contracts for difference,"A contract for difference (CFD) is essentially a contract between an investor and an investment bank or a spread-betting firm.

They also escape stamp duty and can be bought in size without triggering obligations to disclose the holding. A form of synthetic dividend is normally also payable. [1] A CFD is simply an agreement between two parties   the investor and the CFD provider   to pay each other the change in the price of an underlying asset.  Depending on which way the price moves, one party pays the other the difference from the time the contract was agreed to the point where it ends. So like spread bets, CFDs involve the investor taking an opposing view to the insurer, speculating that an asset price will rise, by buying ( long  position), or fall, by selling ( short  position). Also like spread bets, CFDs incur no stamp duty as they do not involve buying an asset, only agreeing to receive or pay the movement in its price. And because you only have to put down a small deposit on trades, called  margin , you can make large profits   or losses   on the money you commit, from small moves in the price.  So CFDs give you the advantages of owning shares without many of the inconveniences.  However, they differ from spread bets in their tax treatment.

contrarian,"A contrarian investor takes positions opposite to the general trend   for instance, selling a stock that most other investors are buying   based on the view that the greater the number of investors that take a certain position, the more likely a price is likely to peak or bottom out. By taking the opposite position when everyone is buying a certain asset, the contrarian avoids buying when the price is high. Likewise if the contrarian investor holds onto a security when everyone is selling it could help to avoid selling when the price is low. There are clearly risks associated with taking a contrarian position.   contrarian in the news In May 2013 a writer commented that Europe should embrace a financial transaction tax especially because it would discourage high frequency traders. High frequency traders  are biased towards contrarian trades, he said, they buy when others sell   and so they provide liquidity, but only when liquidity is plentiful. In times of market disruption, they cease being contrarian and try to get ahead of the trend, draining liquidity when it is needed most, such as before the  flash crash  of May 2010."

controlled foreign companies,"The UK controlled foreign companies (CFC) regime has been substantially revised for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2013. The new CFC regime is a mainly entity-based system which focuses on overseas profits that have been artificially diverted from the UK. It applies to companies controlled from the UK but resident in an overseas territory and is based around a  gateway  test which determines whether or not there are chargeable profits to which a CFC charge may apply. Detailed calculations of chargeable profits that pass through the gateway are only required where it is likely that a CFC charge will arise, as there are a number of entity level exemptions and safe harbours available to exclude profits from the Gateway in particular circumstances. The regime allows for the possibility of low tax financing as a finance profits exemption may apply to exempt 75 per cent of the profits of a foreign finance company to the extent that they arise from qualifying loans to foreign group companies. Thus, such profits will normally only be taxed at a UK effective tax rate of 5.25 per cent (in 2014 falling to 5.0 per cent in 2015).

convertible bond arbitrage,"The convertible bond arbitrage strategy aims to exploit mispricing in convertible bonds, by buying an undervalued convertible bond and taking a short position in the underlying equity. Arbitrageurs typically employ delta-neutral hedging, in which they short the stock according to the current delta of the bond. When arbitrageurs buy the convertible bond, they set up an initial short position so that no profit or loss is generated from very small movements in the underlying stock price; profits are generated from the yield of the convertible bond and the interest rebate of the short position.  After establishing the initial short position, arbitrageurs hedge dynamically to remain delta-neutral.  In particular, if the underlying stock price increases, they short-sell more shares due to the increase in delta. If the stock price decreases, they buy back some shares to cover part of the short position because the delta has decreased. Example Hedge funds are important players in the convertible bond market. In 2003, it was estimated that hedge funds bought 70 per cent of the primary issues. Convertible bond arbitrage hedge funds buy convertible bonds, which are usually underpriced at issuance, and employ the arbitrage strategy to make profits.  The Dow Jones Credit Suisse Convertible Arbitrage Hedge Fund Index is an asset-weighted index that tracks the performance of convertible bond arbitrage hedge funds. [1]"

convertible note,"Convertible notes are often used by angel investors who wish to fund businesses without establishing an explicit valuation of the company in which they are investing.  When an investor purchases equity in a startup, the purchase price of the equity implies a company valuation. For example, if an investor purchases a 10 per cent ownership stake in a company, and pay $1m for that stake, this implies that the company is worth $10m. Some early stage investors may wish to avoid placing a value on the company in this way, because this in turn will affect the terms under which later-stage investors will invest in the company.  Convertible notes are structured as loans at the time the investment is made.  The outstanding balance of the loan is automatically converted to equity when a later equity investor appears, under terms that are governed by the terms set by the later-stage equity investor.  An equity investor is someone who purchases equity in a company. Example Suppose an angel investor invests $100,000 using a convertible note.  Later, an equity investor invests $1m and receives 10% of the company's shares.  In the simplest possible case, the initial angel investor's convertible note would convert to 1/10th of the equity investor's claim.  Depending on the exact structure of the convertible note, however, the angel investor may also receive extra shares to compensate them for the additional risk associated with being an earlier investor. [1]"
convertible preferred equity,"Venture capitalists (VC) frequently use convertible equity to invest in startups.  Convertible preferred equity blends features of debt and equity into a single security.  Typically, the initial investment is structured as a debt claim, earning interest that accrues unpaid by the company. At the discretion of the venture capitalist, the debt can be converted into equity at a conversion price that is determined at the time the investment is made. The venture capitalist s investment is initially structured like a loan to the company   like a loan, the investment accrues interest that the venture capitalist earns.  But unlike most loans, the venture capitalist has the right, but not the obligation, to convert their loan into equity in the company. The conversion price of the convertible preferred equity indicates how many shares of equity the venture capitalist receives in exchange for their loan.  For example, a $10m convertible preferred equity security that converts to common equity at $2/share would convert to 5 million shares of common equity if the venture capitalist chose to convert the security to common equity. To see why the VC might wish to exercise their conversion rights, consider the difference between debt and equity.  In our example, if the company is worth $100m, and it will have 10 million shares outstanding after the conversion to common equity, then each share is worth $10 as common equity after the VC converts.  The terms of their initial agreement allow them to convert their loan at a price of $2 per share, meaning that they can capture $8/share of company value by exercising their conversion right. The debt-like features of the security offer protection to the venture capitalist in the event that the startup performs poorly, while the ability to convert the security to common equity means that the venture capitalist will share proportionately in the success of the company if it is acquired or becomes publicly traded. Example Unlike convertible notes, convertible preferred equity securities place an explicit valuation on the company being funded at the time the investment is made.  This occurs through the conversion price.    For example, if a convertible preferred security offers 1,000,000 shares for a $5,000,000 investment, and each share of the convertible security converts into five shares of common equity, then the act of converting the security to common equity implies that the VC will have paid 1 dollar per share of common equity.

These controversial but widely used tools help websites calculate how many people visit the site, personalise the content that they see and target ads.These are used to build profiles of web surfers by tracking their activities across a network of websites. But the decades-old cookie has its limits, especially as companies seek to track consumers across multiple devices. The way that cookies typically work means a profile of an individual on his or her work computer is separate from the profile created on his or her other devices. Meanwhile, cookies do not work on mobile phones, tablets and other devices and when consumers delete their cookies, those profiles are erased.   cookie in the news Google is looking to replace third-party cookies, the ones installed by companies other than the operator of website you are visiting, such as advertisers. The move signals a growing momentum in the internet and advertising industries to create new techniques for profiling consumers across smartphones, televisions, computers and even billboards. During the past several years, companies have rushed to develop alternative technologies that would allow tracking companies to sync those profiles and create one dossier about an individual based on their activities across multiple screens. Google s approach appears to be an attempt to create an alternative to the cookie while appeasing some privacy concerns. Under discussion at Google is the use of a personal identifier, where internet users would be able to adjust a single setting in their browser to determine how much information about them is given to advertisers. The tech giant is not alone in exploring alternatives to the cookie. Similarly, Apple blocks cookies with its Safari browser and collects information about users with a single personal identifier.

cord cutting,"Cable operators are facing increased pressure in their video businesses from cord cutting, where customers cancel pay-TV subscriptions for cheaper online streaming options, such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. These so-called cord cutters, along with a broader transformation in how people watch television, are a growing threat to the foundations of the media industry, upsetting the balance of power between television distributors, programmers and viewers.   Cord cutting in the news In early 2014, Comcast, the cable industry leader, made a move to win that power back, announcing a $45bn deal to acquire Time Warner Cable. The combination of the top two US cable operators would control about a third of America s video and broadband customers. The tie-up could give the cable group a national platform to create a stronger competitor to Netflix and Amazon. Consumer advocates fear that a Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal would place too much power in the hands of one company. (Comcast also owns NBCUniversal, the entertainment group.) They fear that the combined company would push up the prices of video and broadband services and exert more control over television networks and internet connectivity speeds. Some analysts question whether the deal as it is currently structured would receive the green light from regulators. [1] "

core tier one capital,"Tier one capital is the best form of bank capital - the money that the bank has in its coffers to support all the risks it takes: lending, trading and so on. [1] Tier one is essentially top-notch capital, with core tier one a subset comprising the best of the best. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, whose Basel III rules form the basis for global bank regulation, is focused on the core tier one ratio, which, like the Americans, it refers to as the equity tier one ratio. It essentially will consist of only equity and retained profits. How are the ratios calculated  A bank s capital is measured against its risk-weighted assets   essentially a bank s total assets recalculated to a smaller number to reflect the relatively low-risk nature of some. The average bank today probably has a core tier one ratio of about 7 or 8 per cent, compared with a regulatory minimum of 2 per cent, and a tier one ratio of 9 or 10 per cent, compared with a 4 per cent minimum. So the new requirement for a 7 per cent core tier one ratio will be a breeze for most banks  Well, it certainly won t be as much of a stretch as many banks originally feared. But for banks that are only marginally above it, or expect to be by the end of 2018 when the phase-in period ends, there could be issues. That is because both elements of the ratio are being toughened   what qualifies as core tier one capital is being narrowed to exclude lower-quality instruments. Previously accepted forms of top-notch capital, such as deferred tax assets, are being phased out. The weightings applied to banks  assets will rise in many cases, amplifying the ratio s denominator. This is all a result of the financial crisis, right  Right. In the financial crisis many highly geared banks with a lot of non-equity (such as hybrid debt) in their capital structures were left looking very weak because losses burnt through their relatively thin equity cushions quickly. For that reason, investors have increasingly been interested in how strong banks  core tier one ratios are. To an extent, regulators are just catching up with the market.

corporate cannibalism,"A strategy in which a company brings a new product into a market where it already has an established product line-up and therefore causes declining sales of the incumbent product or, in some cases, obsolescence. A company may do this because the new product may sell better than the previous one or because it wants to increase its market share and believes the move will put its competitors at a disadvantage. Corporate cannibalism is a situation where a company is, more or less, competing with itself. However, it is pervasive in consumer electronics, particularly mobile phones and other devices where advances in technology are swift. ExampleApple Inc is perhaps the most famous example of a corporate cannibal given that releases of its new mobile phones, tablets and laptop computers occur while the existing lineup still sells well.  This is usually planned in order to beat competitors and create sustained interest in its products. [1]"
corporate capital structure,"The composition of a company's capital in terms of equity (common and preferred stock), debt (including bonds and loans) and hybrid securities (such as convertible debt and preferred shares). Equity financing is provided by the shareholders. Debt financing is provided by banks or bondholders who, respectively, receive loan contracts and publicly traded bonds in return for their money. The capital structure shows the composition of a group s liabilities as it shows who has a claim on the group's assets and whether it is a debt or equity claim. The leverage ratio is the proportion of the group s liabilities that is financed by debt claims. The capital structure of corporations can be quite complex as there are many different types of debt and equity claims. For example, debt claims vary according to their maturity (short term or long term), seniority (senior or junior), the type of covenants associated with the debt, whether the debt is secured or unsecured, and whether the debt is privately held or publicly traded. The optimal debt-equity mix is explained by a number of capital structure theories. According to these theories there are costs and benefits associated with debt as well as equity. The company should choose the combination of debt and equity that maximises its value.  According to the trade-off theory of capital structure, companies optimally trade off the tax shield advantage of debt against the expected bankruptcy costs. The interest repayments on debt are tax deductible. This benefit of debt has to be traded off against the increase in expected bankruptcy costs that result from taking on higher debt levels. Highly levered companies are more likely to go bankrupt, and value gets destroyed in bankruptcy, especially if the assets lose a large fraction of their value in bankruptcy. Other theories, such as the pecking order theory of capital structure, invoke the information asymmetry between inside shareholders and outside shareholders. Given that insiders are more likely to issue new shares when shares are overvalued, a company's announcement to issue more shares may lead to a drop in share price. To avoid this adverse selection cost, companies might in the first instance rely on internal financing or debt financing, and only issue new shares as a last resort. This results in a 'pecking order' of financing. Examples Industries in which companies have highly tangible assets that preserve their value in liquidation tend to have high leverage ratios, and vice versa. For example, internet companies, knowledge-based companies and human capital intensive companies all tend to rely primarily on equity financing because their assets are intangible and not suitable as collateral for debt financing.

corporate communication,"Corporate communication is a management function or department, like marketing, finance, or operations, dedicated to the dissemination of information to key constituencies, the execution of corporate strategy and the development of messages for a variety of purposes for inside and outside the organisation.In today s global corporation, this function serves as the conscience of the corporation and is responsible for the organisation s reputation.  Previously called  public relations  or  public affairs,  corporate communication has taken on new importance in the 21st century as a result of corporate scandals or crises at companies like Enron and Toyota.The department usually oversees communication strategy, media relations, crisis communications, internal communications, reputation management, corporate responsibility, investor relations, government affairs and sometimes marketing communication.The person running the department is the chief communications officer of the firm, and reports directly to the chief executive officer in many of the top global organisations due to the critical importance of the function today. Example Jon Iwata, the chief communications officer for IBM, oversees a large department focused on both marketing and communications for the company. This global function is responsible for IBM s communications to all key constituencies including customers, employees and communities.  It also plays a role in shaping and executing the company s Smarter Planet strategy, and initiative focused on developing sophisticated systems to make the world a better place like smart grids and efficient water management systems. Jon works closely with Sam Palmisano, CEO of IBM, on strategy execution, and is a member of the company s most senior management team. [1]"
corporate culture,"Corporate culture is seen in an organisation s behaviour and its structure. A hierarchical company may have individual offices, a formal environment and intricate rules regarding travel allowances and dress code.  It used to be said, for example, that you could recognise IBM employees when travelling for business because of their formal dark suits and ties. Companies emphasising equality and innovation will demonstrate these values visibly too, for instance, Apple is famous for its casual dress and elegant product design.  At Intel, which is known for its culture of face-to-face open discussions, everyone, including the top executives, works in the same size office cubicle and even senior managers fly economy class.  Such symbols send powerful messages about a company s culture. Example In the global context, many companies must identify the DNA of their cultures   what makes them who they are   and invite their country operations to adapt the rest to local business culture. Agreeing on and strengthening the DNA is important so that  employees across operations will better understand corporate goals and the acceptable ways of reaching them. Such alignment leads to better and more consistent business results. There are ways of trying to adapt to a culture, for instance, an European printing group wanted to be more relevant to their staff in China after unsatisfactory results from an employee engagement survey. They decided to focus on how the global corporate values applied locally.  One value was  being proactive . After extensive discussions, the Chinese managers suggested redefining this value for the local operation as  regulation of oneself for the sake of improvement.  This helped staff take individual responsibility with the goal of helping the group. [1] Employees who want exposure to the emerging countries such as the Brics - Brazil, Russia, India and China - ""must decide whether to export existing corporate cultures or adapt to their varied local working habits.  For example, interruptions during presentations are welcomed in Brazil, where business cards should be printed in both English and Portuguese, but in India, where English is an official language, such behaviour is less acceptable. In Russia employees are entitled to 28 days annual leave, while in China workers are required to work at weekends to make up time lost during national holidays.""

corporate divestiture,"Corporate divestiture is a strategy to remove some of a group s assets under its current business portfolio. Depending on the purpose of restructuring, divestitures can take several forms, such as sell-offs, spin-offs, or equity carve-out. The term corporate divestiture is usually interchangeable with that of corporate divestment. One of the most common reasons for divestiture is removing underperforming business units. This should help reduce operating losses and achieve higher organisational efficiency. Through corporate divestiture, firms are also able to obtain funds, allowing them to pay off some debt and use capital more wisely in other operations. Many groups employ corporate divestiture with an aim to restore focus on their core businesses through the selling off of unrelated business units. Managers of firms might be motivated to divest business assets that operate in highly volatile or unstable market conditions in order to reduce their own employment risk. Finally, some corporate divestiture can be forced. For example, regulatory authorities might use legal action to demand a divestment from a company due to antitrust or anticompetitive practices.  Example A company can experience decreased financial performance when its business portfolio is over-diversified after a series of mergers and acquisitions. When that occurs, managers might perform corporate divestiture through sell-offs or spin-offs in order to improve performance and restore focus on the company s core business. A prominent example is PepsiCo Inc, which expanded rapidly from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s through the acquisition of several non-core business lines. Eventually PepsiCo had to sell and spin off several of them - including Pizza Hut, KFC, and Taco Bell - during the late 1990s in order to maintain its focus on snack food and beverages.

corporate governance,"Economists have long noted that publicly traded companies suffer from an incentive problem.  The people who run the company (management) are not the same as the people who own the company (shareholders) or who otherwise have a stake in its success (stakeholders). Managers are paid professionals with their own self interests.  In order to prevent managers from making decisions that benefit themselves but that are detrimental to others, a system of checks and balances is put in place.  This system is called  corporate governance.   At a minimum, governance systems include a board of directors (to hire, fire, and compensate management) and an external auditor (to make sure financial statements are accurate).  Other constituents such as creditors, customers, suppliers, labour unions, the media, and regulators also play a role in corporate governance by making sure that management behaves appropriately. ExampleIt is easier to point out examples of  bad  governance than  good  governance.  The most famous example of bad governance is Enron.  Executives lied about Enron s financial results for years in order to increase the value of personal stock options.  Their actions went undetected by the board, the auditor, ratings agencies, regulators, and the media for many years until the company ultimately collapsed into bankruptcy.  If Enron had had a more effective governance system in place, this behavior would have been detected many years earlier and management would have been replaced.

corporate pay-out,"In the initial stages of a firm s lifecycle, shareholders contribute cash to the firm. As the firm matures it typically returns cash to its shareholders. A corporation can pay out cash to its shareholders in two ways: it can pay a dividend or it can repurchase shares. Dividends are set by the board of directors and a particular dividend is paid to all shareholders who are registered on a particular record date. Shares that are bought after the record date trade ex-dividend, which means that the buyer is not entitled to the dividend. For this reason share prices typically drop in value on the ex-dividend date by an amount close to the net dividend per share. Instead of paying a dividend to its shareholders, the company can use the cash to repurchase shares. As such, share repurchases are another way of distributing cash to shareholders. Companies can repurchase shares in a number of ways. For example, the company can buy shares back in the open market at the prevailing price just like any other investor. Open market repurchases are by far the most common form of share repurchases, but other forms include accelerated buy-back. Occasionally companies repurchase through a tender offer in which they buy back a stated number of shares at a fixed price. Shareholders then decide whether they wish to sell shares at the price offered. How do companies determine the amount of cash they wish to pay out to investors  This is not a trivial question because pay-out decisions are linked to investment and financing policies. Indeed, a pound paid out could instead be used for investment purposes or to reduce the firm s net amount of debt outstanding. Despite this apparent complexity corporate pay-out appears to behave in a reasonably predictable fashion: pay-out is linked to earnings but in a smoothed fashion. Pay-out is driven by long run sustainable income, with transitory earnings shocks having little or no effect on pay-out. Furthermore, companies rarely cut pay-out. As a result pay-out is smooth relative to earnings. Example In 2000 and 20011, Exxon Mobil paid out billions of dollars in cash to its shareholders through share repurchases.  Exxon Mobil has one of the largest and most consistent stock buy-back programmes in the United States. As of the end of 2011, Exxon Mobil has paid uninterrupted dividends on its common stock since 1882 and increased payments to common shareholders every year for 28 years. [1]"

corporate reputation,"The term refers to the observers  collective judgments of a corporation based on assessments of financial, social and environmental impacts attributed to the corporation over time. Example  Many agencies or companies publicly assess the reputations of corporations.  One of these is Fortune magazine which produces a global annual rating called the  world s most admired companies .  The criteria used to rank these companies include innovation, quality of management, people management, financial soundness, social responsibility, product/services quality and global competitiveness.  In 2010, Apple was ranked number one, followed by Google. The Reputation Institute also carries out a project called the Global Reputation Pulse   this researches the reputations of the world's largest companies and identifies the ones with 'the best corporate reputations . Reputation rating agencies often use differing criteria and methods.  As a result, though financial performance proves the most predictive factor of reputation score, the ratings vary considerably across assessors. [1]"
corporate responsibility,"Corporations have a responsibility to those groups and individuals that they can affect, i.e., its stakeholders, and to society at large. Stakeholders are usually defined as customers, suppliers, employees, communities and shareholders or other financiers. The responsibility to society at large may well be identical with the responsibility to its various communities.  Many have suggested that corporations have a special  social responsibility  over and above its business purpose.  In any case corporate responsibility consists of earning a licence to operate by creating value for stakeholders, including shareholders, and society. Corporate responsibility includes being consistent with ethical principles and conduct such as honesty, integrity and respect for others.   By voluntarily accepting responsibility for its actions corporations earn their licence to operate in society. ExampleCompanies earn a licence to operate by creating products and services that their customers value, by creating jobs for employees whom they treat fairly and in accordance with the law, and by complying with other applicable laws. In a case where a company s products are discovered to be harmful to customers, or where their products or operations are deemed harmful to the general public, a company s licence to operate can become imperiled. This may result in penalties that enforce existing laws and regulations, or new laws and regulations that in extreme cases put a company out of business. [1]"

corporate social responsibility  (CSR),"Movement aimed at encouraging companies to be more aware of the impact of their business on the rest of society, including their own stakeholders and the environment. [1] Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a business approach that contributes to sustainable development by delivering economic, social and environmental benefits for all stakeholders. CSR is a concept with many definitions and practices. The way it is understood and implemented differs greatly for each company and country. Moreover, CSR is a very broad concept that addresses many and various topics such as human rights, corporate governance, health and safety, environmental effects, working conditions and contribution to economic development. Whatever the definition is, the purpose of CSR is to drive change towards sustainability.Although some companies may achieve remarkable efforts with unique CSR initiatives, it is difficult to be on the forefront on all aspects of CSR. Considering this, the example below provides good practices on one aspect of CSR   environmental sustainability. Example Unilever is a multinational corporation, in the food and beverage sector, with a comprehensive CSR strategy. The company has been ranked  Food Industry leader  in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Indexes for the 11 consecutive years and ranked 7th in the  Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World . One of the major and unique initiatives is the  sustainable tea  programme.  On a partnership-based model with the Rainforest Alliance (an NGO), Unilever aims to source all of its Lipton and PG Tips tea bags from Rainforest Alliance Certified  farms by 2015.  The Rainforest Alliance Certification offers farms a way to differentiate their products as being socially, economically and environmentally sustainable. [2]"

corporate tax road map,"The UK coalition government set out a high-level roadmap of corporate tax reform in the 2010  emergency  Budget. The aim of the package of measures announced was to improve the competitiveness of the UK s corporate tax system. On 29 November 2010, the government updated the roadmap and published several consultation documents. The roadmap restated the Government s aim to create the most competitive corporate tax regime in the G20.  The roadmap set out how the government intended to approach the corporate tax system over the following five years and included documents focussed on the following areas:   The general principles and timetable for reform; Reform of the controlled foreign company rules; The role of intellectual property, including the introduction of a patent box and a consultation on the reform of the R&D; tax credits system; and Proposals for the reform of the taxation of foreign branches.

corporate venture capital,"This is a special form of venture capital in which non-financial firms invest in target companies such as startups or buyouts. These investments often follow not only purely financial interests, but also pursue strategic goals in developing new or complementary technologies or business fields to those in which the firm is already active. This objective is often described as ""window on technology"" to have early and better access to innovations. The goals of the target companies comprise the access to additional financing as well as a strengthening of research and development or marketing and distribution channels. ExampleThe ""window on technology"" approach may for example comprise the closer observation of technological developments and innovation, often with a lean and entrepreneurial organisational structure that might not be maintained in larger companies. This approach could, for example, result in technology transfer from the target firm to the acquiring firm or to a better combination of resources in the acquiring and the target firm. [1]"

corporation tax,"Companies are subject to corporation tax, which is levied on business profits and other forms of income, as well as on chargeable gains accruing to companies. Corporation tax is charged on the profits of a 'financial year' which runs from 1 April. The profits of a company are calculated by reference to its accounting periods and are then, where necessary, apportioned on a time basis between the financial years in which the accounting period falls.  See also corporation tax deductions. [1]   corporation tax in the news In the UK Summer Budget 2015 speech, the government announced that corporation tax will be cut to 19 per cent in 2017. An FT reporter wrote: ""Cutting corporation tax to 18 per cent by 2020 will be seen as an act of economic warfare by some in the US, Germany and France, where headline rates are 30 per cent or above. A barrage of criticism of the UK as a tax haven will probably ensue."" [2]"
corporation tax deductions,"In general, in order to arrive at the taxable profits for a company, expenses are deductible provided that they are of a revenue nature rather than a capital nature and that they are wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purposes of the trade or business.There are special provisions that determine the timing of or the deductibility of certain specific types of expenditure, for example no deduction is allowed for expenditure on business gifts and business entertainment although exceptions apply for certain small gifts. Capital allowances are available for certain categories of expenditure (see capital allowances) instead of commercial depreciation. Dividends are not deductible, whereas interest and royalties generally are (with certain restrictions). [1]"

correction,"When a market or the price of an asset reverses in order to compensate for having gone too far in a certain direction, thus ""correcting"" its earlier course. In technical analysis, the term can be used either for an upwards or downwards change, but in general, it is understood as a decline that corrects prices that have risen too high. For a rise, it is better to specify it as an ""upwards correction""."
correlation,"To talk of a correlation is to express the strength of the relationship between two variables. A correlation is said to be positive if movements between the two variables are in the same direction and negative if it moves in the opposite direction. A correlation of zero means there is no correlation at all between the two variables. Investment managers are interested in correlation in a portfolio because they do not want the value of all investments to fall simultaneously. Instead the ideal is to find investments which perform differently in different investment climates. Traditionally an investment manager might have been able to achieve this simply by investing in bonds and equities   in risk averse investment climates investors would buy bonds, encouraging bond prices to rise, and in times when investors felt more confident about future performance they would raise their exposure to equities. However, during the 2008/2009 financial crisis most asset classes performed equally badly. Investment managers and central bankers are also interested in the correlation between other variables that can give a clue to future price direction. For example, in December 2013, An FT writer pointed out the declining correlation between energy and non-energy inflation.   correlation in the news In December 2013 Mark Haefele, global head of investment at UBS Wealth Management, writing for FT Alphaville spoke about the increasing correlation between commodities and other investment strategies.

He suggests that just as the efficient markets hypothesis has gained wide acceptance, so will his observation that the mathematical expectation of the long-term investor is a shortfall to the stock market's return   a shortfall that is equal to the costs of our system of financial intermediation. In other words, advisory fees, brokerage commissions, transactions costs, custody and legal fees and securities processing expenses all add up to take away from the investor. Mr Bogle estimated that intermediation costs accounted for 3% of the value of the US equity market.   cost matters hypothesis in the news In March 2010, an FT columnist observed that although no one much believes in the efficient market hypothesis anymore, its lesser known cousin, the CMH appears to go from strength to strength."

[1] In order to provide an incentive for those willing to provide capital, the risk-adjusted return on the capital used to fund any given business needs to be higher than the cost of the capital.A company s assets are financed by either debt or equity. Risk-adjusted return on capital is the average of the costs of these sources of financing, each of which is weighted by its respective use in the given situation.

The return consists both of dividend and capital gains. The returns are expected future returns, not historical returns.  There are two formulae commonly used to determine cost of equity. The first is the dividend growth model, which is (next year's forecast annual dividend divided by the current stock price) + the anticipated dividend growth rate. The other formula is the capital asset pricing model, a more complicated formula which includes risk assumptions.   cost of equity in the news In October 2013, an FT writer was considering valuation metrics for Twitter's planned IPO.

country of origin (COO) bias,"The extent to which consumers' evaluation of a product is driven by the product's country of origin (the 'made in' label). Such effects can have a favourable or unfavourable impact on consumer evaluations. In many product categories, consumers use country of origin as a cue to judge the quality, prestige or performance of the product. When there is a match between the perceived 'strength' of the country and the desired product features, the country of origin label will have a favourable effect. Consumers prefer German-made cars because of the association of Germany with craftsmanship and engineering. Italy and France enjoy a positive image for design and style. As a result, luxury goods originating from these countries enjoy a favourable COO image. To cope with unfavourable COO images, companies can resort to several strategies including: - building up strong brand equity (eg, Hyundai, Corona beer) - disguising the country of origin (eg, Giordano and Bossini, Hong Kong based clothing brands) - boosting the country image for the category (Chilean wines) - buying brands with a favorable COO image (eg, acquisition of Volvo and Jaguar/Land Rover by Geely and Tata, respectively). Example Herborist is a Chinese skincare brand marketed by state-owned Shanghai Jahwa, one of China's largest personal care firms.  The company aspires to turn Herborist into a high-end global skincare brand. Unfortunately, China has a poor quality image for personal care and food products. To counter that image, Shanghai Jahwa changed the tagline for Herborist to  made in Shanghai . In promoting the brand, it also stresses that the brand is grounded in traditional Chinese herbal science. [1]    See Article: 'Made in China' does not always translate well  "

They give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset, at a specified price, on or before a predetermined date. Covered warrants are only issued by financial institutions, unlike normal warrants which are issued by corporations. Covered warrants provide gearing by only requiring investors to commit a fraction of the price it would cost to purchase the underlying asset directly. Example: - an underlying share price is 100p - a covered warrant on that share may be trading at 20p - an investor buying the warrant at 20p is gaining exposure to price movements in an asset worth 100p, a gearing of five times Investors talking about covered warrants often also mention delta. The delta of a covered warrant measure the sensitivity of the option price to the cange in the price of the underlying asset.  Example: - a delta of 40 per cent means that if the price of the underlying asset increases by  1.00 the price of the covered warrant increases by  0.40. - the higher the delta, the higher the price of a covered warrant (and therefore the less risky the product). Leverage, or effective gearing, is the degree to which the covered warrant's price magnifies the price movement of the underlying asset.  Covered warrants with leverage of four times might be expected to move approximately four times as much in percentage terms as the price of their underlying asset. But leverage can only ever be an approximation because the figure changes constantly with changes to the price of the underlying asset, the warrants and the time to expiry.                                      There are two types of covered warrant: call and put, allowing the holder to benefit from rising or falling asset prices. With a call warrant the holder has the right, but not the obligation, to buy an underlying asset at a predetermined price (the exercise or strike price) on or before a date in the future (the expiry or exercise date). So a call warrant usually rises in value when the underlying asset rises in value, as it gives the right to buy the asset more cheaply and make a profit. Example: - a call warrant gives the right to buy one share at 110p. If the current share price is 100p, the warrant price might start at 5p as there is only limited potential for profit if the share price later rises. If the share price does rise to 130p (a rise of 30 per cent) the warrant price would rise to at least 20p which is an increase of 300 per cent.  With a pull warrant the holder has the right but not the obligation to sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a date in the future. So a put warrant normally rises in value when the underlying asset falls in value, as it gives the holder the right to sell at a higher price. example: a put warrant gives the right to sell one share at 90p. If the current share price is 100p, the warrant price might start at 5p, as there is only some potential for profit if the share price later falls. But if the share price does fall to 60p, for example, a fall of 40 per cent, the warrant price would rise to 30p (a rise of 500 per cent), as the right to sell at 90p is 'worth' 30p.  "

An outlook is not necessarily a precursor of a rating change, and is often used to maintain the stability of long-term ratings. The outlook provides information to investors on the potential evolution of a rating, hence it increases the precision of the rating. ExampleFor rating agencies such as Moody s, Fitch and Standard & Poor's, a positive outlook means that a rating may be raised. A negative means that a rating may be lowered, stable means that a rating is not likely to change and developing (or evolving) means that a rating may be raised or lowered. [1]"

credit rating,"Also called debt rating, this is a method of measuring the creditworthiness of a debt issuer. The ratings provided by the main credit rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's (S&P;) and Fitch, evaluate issuers worldwide and are very closely followed. A top rating means there is almost no likelihood of the borrower failing to meet interest payments or full redemption of the issue. [1] Credit ratings are opinions expressed on an alphanumeric scale on the relative ability and willingness of a debt issuer to meet financial commitments. Credit ratings published by the main global rating agencies aim to provide ratings that are objective and transparent, as well as consistent and comparable across instruments, maturities, industries and countries. Some sectors, maturities and countries have their own specific rating scales.The long-term global rating scale at S&P; and Fitch contain nine grades and goes from the highest grade to the lowest grade (in increasing order of riskiness): AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C. For Moody's, the scale contains nine grades and goes from the highest grade to the lowest grade (in increasing order of riskiness): Aaa, Aa, A, Baa, Ba, B, Caa, Ca, C.All three global credit rating agencies, for each full grade other than AAA (or Aaa), CC (or Ca), or C, include a positive, neutral or negative modifier for Fitch and S&P; or a numerical modifier for Moody s. This brings the nine point rating scale to a 21 point scale. For instance, for the AA grade there are AA+, AA, AA- or Aa1, Aa2, Aa3. [2] Example Government credit ratings take into account three main elements. These are public debt as a percentage of gross domestic product, the budget deficit (the amount government spending exceeds income) and debt affordability (interest costs as a percentage of revenue). In 2011, Germany with a triple A rating, has a debt-to-GDP ratio of 73 per cent, a deficit of 3 per cent and a debt affordability ratio of 5 per cent. B plus rated Greece has debt-to-GDP at 127 per cent, a deficit of 15 per cent and debt affordability on 15 per cent. [3]"

crossing networks,"The network provides a platform for mutual funds and institutional traders to conduct transactions without revealing their identity. The alternative trading systems (ATS) allows buyers and sellers to match up and conduct transactions without going through an exchange.

crowdfunding,"Crowdfunding is a new and emerging way of funding new ideas or projects by borrowing funding from large numbers of people often accessed through a website.                          In these markets, any individual can propose an idea that requires funding, and interested others can contribute funds to support the idea. These markets have recently emerged as a viable alternative for sourcing capital to support innovative, entrepreneurial ideas and ventures. A novel aspect of crowdfunded markets is the nature of the publicly observable popularity indicators typically recorded and published within the marketplace. For instance, the information on prior investments in crowdfunded markets typically includes a time stamp and the specific amount contributed, or both. These values contribute to what is often referred to as a project s current  funding status'. This status encompasses prior funding decisions made by others regarding a particular project, indicating the total funds raised, the number of contributors, and the duration over which that funding has taken place. Most crowdfunding offerings don't involve an ""ownership"" stake. Hence, equity sales are prohibited by regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US. Recently, however, regulation is in the works to ease such constraints and enable equity stakes. [1]   crowdfunding in the news In May 2013 an FT columnist noted that the time was right for new faces in finance. The report noted that the UK Crowdfunding Association had been set up earlier in the year with 12 members and that Crowdonomic, a website for Asian crowdfunding sources, had also launched in Singapore. Despite the popularity of the idea, a report published in April 2013 noted that crowdfunding on a large scale was hampered in the US by onerous filing and disclosure requirements and by caps on the amount lenders could lend and borrowers could borrow."
crowding out,"When government actions discourage businesses and consumers from following suit. Most often used in relation to excessive government borrowing, which pushes up interest rates and acts as a disincentive to other potential borrowers, in turn leading to a slowdown in economic activity."
crowdsourcing,"A business model or function that relies on a large group of users as third parties for outsourcing certain tasks. The popular use of the internet makes communication and coordination progressively cheap: tasks that would have been impossible to communicate and coordinate before have become extremely easy to set up and coordinate. Crowdsourcing can add significant value to a product or service, and can also generate valuable connections between the users and the company. ExampleGoogle builds its index through a crowdsourcing process with users determining the position of the pages in the rank through actions such as linking or clicking. Twitter achieves most of its value crowdsourcing its users, assuming that there will always be a Twitter user present wherever news stories take place. Foursquare, a social networking mobile phone site that encourages people to explore their local area, relies on crowdsourcing its users to fill its huge catalog of places.

cultural agility,"Cultural agility is the ability to understand multiple local contexts and work within them to obtain consistent business results.  For today s global organisations, cultural agility is the new competitive edge. While individual capacities are important, successful organisations build an institutional level of a global mindset and skills for effectively coordinating, negotiating and influencing across boundaries. Building cultural agility often includes making structural changes as an organisation moves from active operations in a few countries to multiple continents.  This brings about diversity of experience and thinking and this usually results in better business decisions. Example Crucial changes may include:  having board members live in different geographies.  For example, Martin Bruderm ller is the Hong Kong-based executive board member and head of BASF s Asia-Pacific operations - the German chemical company; relocating division headquarters in their growth markets and away from their place of origin in order to force better understanding of customer context.  For example, 3M, the Amercan technology company, moved the headquarters of its LCD-filmmaking optical systems business to Asia in 2008.  Also Clariant, the Swiss chemicals group, is relocating the headquarters of its textile chemicals business unit to Singapore in 2011.  promoting executives from other regions into the global board.  For example, James Wei, a Chinese national is on the executive board of Beiersdorf (German-based skin care company), companies such as ABB (Swiss-Swedish engineering group) and Bayer Schering Pharma (German-based pharamaceutical company) have board members of Asian and Middle Eastern origin) ; ensuring global representation in the talent pipeline.   While emerging markets multinationals often have an inherently better  understanding of the contexts of other dynamic markets, they also struggle with  building cultural agility. For example, Chinese firms going global are  challenged by needing to adapt their hierarchical style that centralises decision and holds onto information in markets where employees expect to be granted  responsibility, autonomy and trust. [1] ViewBASF set for  1bn China investment"
cultural friction,"The extent to which two or more entities, such as organisations, units, teams, groups, and individuals, from different countries culturally resist (think or act in opposition, shaped by implicit beliefs and tacit values) each other in real contact or interactions over the course of international business activities or transactions. Unlike cultural distance, cultural friction emphasizes the actual cultural contact between exchanging entities in an environment where multilevel yet intertwined cultural differences simultaneously occur. Example Many US firms, such as Motorola, GM, Procter & Gamble, and Lucent Technologies, have been operating in China for more than two decades. As a result, the effect and relevance of national-level cultural differences or distance, often measured by power distance, individualism-collectivism, masculinity-femininity, and uncertainty avoidance, on impeding local operations and management has drastically declined.  However, cultural friction between foreign and local teams, groups and individuals rises in routine interactions as these companies increase their localisation and fortify their engagement with local business stakeholders, such as suppliers, distributors, banks, logistics providers, and the like.[1]"

currency board,"A fixed exchange rate system that emphasizes the need for strict discipline by a country's monetary authorities. They must hold foreign currency reserves worth at least 100 per cent of issued domestic currency, and cannot increase the amount of currency issued if the reserves backup is not sufficient.  A currency board system limits the ability to respond to external shocks, as the currency is pegged to another country's currency (see currency peg) and monetary authorities have little flexibility to control money supply or interest rates. Economic adjustment must therefore take place through changes in price/wage levels and asset values."

In an indirect quote the target currency is given a value of 1 and the domestic currency fluctuates according to the currencies' relative values. The first currency quoted (eg EUR/USD) in the pair is usually the base currency, however, this can change depending on global conventions for trading the pair.    currency pairs in the news In March 2013 it was reported that trade in one currency pair, the euro vs the yen, remained popular.

currency wars,"The term currency wars, coined in September 2010 by Guido Mantega, Brazil s finance minister, refers to monetary and exchange rate policies designed to lower the value of one s currency. In late 2010 many countries had policies in place that would, all else equal, put downward pressure on their own currencies. Such policies, which could improve economic growth in one s country at the expense of growth in other countries, these policies used to be called beggar-thy-neighbour monetary policies. Mantega labelled these currency wars. ExampleIn late 2010, the central banks of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan (among other countries) intervened in currency markets in an effort to make their currencies cheaper, China was keeping the value of the renminbi from increasing, and monetary policies in the US and the eurozone were very expansionary. Taken together, these policies would tend to put upward pressure on other countries  currencies. These actions were both direct, in the case of currency intervention in which one s own currency was sold in order to purchase (and, hence, put upward pressure on the value of) a foreign currency, and indirect, in the case of expansionary monetary policy that lowered one s own interest rates and prompted investors to shift portfolios toward currencies with higher interest rates.

customer co-development,"Customer co-development is a much less radical innovation process change than user innovation. Customer co-development means that producers try to gain the benefits of direct user design advice while still retaining full intellectual property rights and control over new product and service development.  Producers carry out co-development by inviting a few users to come to their development laboratories to participate in design activities along with their in-house team of professional developers. The advantage of customer co-development is that firms get to work more closely with a few customers.  The disadvantage is that these few customers become directly involved in the culture of the innovating company, and what often comes out is a compromise between what the customer really wants and what the internal product developers think he or she wants. Examples When Starbucks or Nike or Nokia asks customers to come and talk with their product developers, that is a kind of customer co-development. [1]"
customer lifetime value,Another name for lifetime value. [1] 
customer loyalty,"Customer loyalty can be said to have occurred if people choose to use a particular shop or buy one particular product, rather than use other shops or buy products made by other companies.  Customers exhibit customer loyalty when they consistently purchase a certain product or brand over an extended period of time. As an example, many customers stick to a certain travel operator due to the positive experiences they have had with their products and services.                        Customer loyalty is the key objective of customer relationship management and describes the loyalty which is established between a customer and companies, persons, products or brands. The individual market segments should be targeted in terms of developing customer loyalty. Four different reasons for loyalty should be promoted:  psychological; economic; technical/functional; contractual.  Example PsychologicalCustomers might also develop a sense of loyalty to a certain person working for a company.  People can build up a good relationship with a bank advisor they have known for several years and who has always fulfilled their expectations.  The fact that people develop a sense of loyalty can be described as a psychological reason to stick to a specific product. EconomicIn business-to-business markets, it might also be possible that customer loyalty results from the fact that switching to another company would lead to the company facing economic disadvantages. In this case, loyalty is based on economic grounds.Technical/ functionalFurthermore, it might be possible that a company adjusted and adapted its technical procedures to a particular supplier and a change would cause immense technical problems, thus, technical or functional reasons are the grounds for customer loyalty.ContractualA contractual reason for loyalty exists if a customer is bound to the company for a certain period of time due to a contractual agreement and for legal reasons. [1] Loyalty is an old-fashioned word traditionally used to describe fidelity and enthusiastic devotion to a country, a cause, or an individual. It has also been used in a business context, to describe a customer s willingness to continue patronising a firm over the long term, preferably on an exclusive basis, and recommending the firm s products to friends and associates (Lovelock and Wirtz 2011). Customer loyalty is widely seen as a key determinant of a firm s profitability. We can differentiate between behavioural and attitudinal loyalty, also referred to as share-of-wallet and share-of-heart respectively.  Behavioural loyalty refers to customers buying exclusively or mostly only one brand, whereas attitudinal loyalty is all about having an emotional attachment to a brand, liking it more than others, and even loving it. These two types of loyalty are independent, for example, one can give a 100 percent share-of-wallet to a bus company that passes one s home to work, but would still be deeply unhappy with that organisation s service and be ready to switch as soon as a viable alternative is on offer. True loyalty requires both share-of-wallet and share-of-heart so that customers continue buying even when situational factors may make a repeat purchase difficult, such as stock outage or alternative providers trying to persuade customers to switch using promotional offers. However, attitudinal loyalty in itself is not a guarantee of profitability and firms need to be efficient in translating these attitudes and loyalty intentions into actual loyalty behaviours.  This includes:  increased share-of-wallet such as encouraging a customer to buy more from a brand, and less from its competitors which results in selling more units to a customer; up-selling to higher level products, meaning selling more expensive, higher value products, which results in the higher revenue from the customer for a constant number of products sold; cross-selling of products the customers currently does not buy, this means in addition to the products a customer already buys, a company sells different products to that customer; referrals such as customer gives positive word-of-mouth and recommendations to buy the firm s products to friends and associates that lead to sales.  ExampleMany Apple customers show absolute loyalty to Apple and even dislike competing products. Apple fans identify with its trendy brand and love its integrated and smart solutions, sleek design and excellent product quality. These customers seem to increasingly live in an  Apple-world , where they tightly integrate the use of several Apple products such as their MacBook, iPod, iPhone and iPad).  They frequently download and buy software, apps, songs and ebooks from Apple s Store and iTunes. These customers have a deeply held commitment to re-buy and re-patronise Apple products and services consistently in the future, against all odds and at all costs despite strong marketing efforts of competitors (adapted from a definition of customer loyalty from Oliver 1997).

customer satisfaction,"Satisfaction is as a judgment following a consumption experience - it is the consumer s judgment that a product provided (or is providing) a pleasurable level of consumption-related fulfillment (adapted from Oliver 1997). Most research confirms that the confirmation or disconfirmation of pre-consumption expectations is the essential determinant of satisfaction. This means that customers have a certain predicted product performance in mind prior to consumption. During consumption, customers experience the product performance and compare it to their expected product performance level. Satisfaction judgments are then formed based on this comparison. The resulting judgment is labeled positive disconfirmation if the performance is better than expected, negative disconfirmation if it is worse than expected, and simple confirmation if it is as expected.  In short, customers evaluate product performance by comparing what they expected with what they believe they received. ExampleLet us take for instance, an airline passenger David who has bought an economy class ticket from London to Singapore.  He paid a premium of  450 for a direct flight rather than one that had a four-hour stopover in Dubai.  He had firm expectations that his travel time would be short.  Now, imagine that there was a six-hour flight delay and he had to wait these many hours at the airport. He had high expectations as he paid a premium price for high-quality product/ airline and now was deeply disappointed when the product failed to deliver. He was very dissatisfied. Assume the same scenario, but this time, not only was the flight on time, but David was also upgraded to business class.  His expectations were exceeded, and he was highly satisfied.

customer-centric,"Customer-centric products, services, or businesses pay more attention to the needs of customers than to sales or profit. [1] "
customer-centric innovation,"Customer-centric innovation revolves around customers and their needs. The process starts with insights on customer needs with the goal of designing a new product or service that delivers on these needs in a way that is intuitive and accessible to customers.Customers may be involved in various ways, for example, ideas generation, market research and at-home testing.It is possible for a company to be customer-centric without surveying customers directly and explicitly as insights about needs may be obtained by simply observing customers in their natural environment. ExamplesIn 2004, Bank of America (BofA) decided to adopt a customer-centric approach in order to entice mothers to open savings accounts. Researchers from BofA and a partnering design firm followed mothers across the US and observed their daily routines. This observational study revealed that many mothers would round up their financial transactions, and that they had trouble saving money.Based on these insights, the firm developed the  keep the change  account, which rounds up to the nearest dollar on all purchases made with a Bank of America debit card and transfers the difference into a savings account.Launched in 2005, this service attracted 2.5 million customers in its first year, opening more than 700,000 new chequing accounts and one million new savings accounts for BofA.In another example, Credit Suisse explored how to make its branches more suitable to navigate and use for senior customers. The most powerful tool for understanding customers is to live like them. Following this principle, senior managers from Credit Suisse personally went out and performed routine banking operations wearing a special suit called the  age explorer. This suit simulates aging, using for example splints and restrictors that limit the movement of joints and simulate the loss of mobility caused by aging and arthritis.  Yellow goggles and surgical style gloves were used to mimic the declining vision and tactile sensitivity experienced by many senior people. With this suit on, senior Credit Suisse managers were able to gain a much deeper understanding of what it feels like to bank when one is 70 years old and has arthritis. [1]"

cyber espionage,"Cyber espionage describes the stealing of secrets stored in digital formats or on computers and IT networks. [1]  ExampleIn 2012, European security researchers report that a cyber espionage virus found on personal computers in several countries in the Middle East is designed to eavesdrop on financial transactions and perhaps disable industrial control systems. Researchers at Kaspersky Lab, a Russian IT security company, in Moscow identified the surveillance virus, dubbed Gauss, on PCs in Lebanon and other countries in the region and say it appears to have been developed by the same team or  factory  that built the Stuxnet and Flame computer viruses. Stuxnet, which was first discovered in 2010, is widely believed to have been used by the US and Israel to attack computer-controlled centrifuges at a uranium enrichment facility in Iran which disrupted the country's nuclear programme. Similarly, Flame, which was discovered in 2012, has been implicated in an attack on a computer system at Iran s main oil export terminal and its oil ministry. Analysis of the Gauss virus has revealed that it contains multiple modules designed to collect information and send detailed data about the infected machines back to its creators. Kaspersky said it is also capable of stealing data from the clients of several Lebanese banks. [2] ViewNew cyber spying virus found in Lebanon"
cyber security,"Cyber security is the protection of computers, data, networks and programs against unauthorised access or attack by individuals, groups, companies, and governments. Threats range from cyber espionage to cyber crime and, at a national level, cyberwarfare. Cyber security is a growing concern for companies, for whom threats are now akey boardroom issue.  Companies' efforts to protect against cyber attacks are however being undermined by their staff's non-compliance with policies designed to prevent data breaches.    cyber security in the news In May 2013, the FT interviewed the head of IT security at British American Tobacco who said the there was a rising need to address cyber security concerns as companies deal with more data leaks where information purposely or inadvertently falls into the wrong hands. At the same time, regulatory issues are placing their own demands on companies. Despite the rising need for a cyber security strategy, in April 2013 a survey revealed that nine out of 10 people knowingly breach their employer's data policies, with senior executives being the worst offenders."
cybernetics,"The scientific study of the way in which information is moved about and controlled in machines and in the human brain. In business, cybernetics is mainly concerned with making industrial processes fully automatic and presenting information so that decisions can be made. [1] "
cyberslacker,"An employee who spends a lot of time on the Internet doing activities that are not related to their job, for example shopping or emailing friends. [1] "
cybersquatting,The illegal practice of registering a domain name putting an Internet address on an official list with the intention of selling it to another company in order to make a profit. [1]
cyberwarfare,"Cyberwarfare is the word used to define the most aggressive form of attack by a foe or rival over the internet. It largely applies to actions by states and involves denying internet services to communities or countries, or, at worst, destroying critical infrastructure or industrial facilities. One other use of the term is to describe activity by a national army that might accompany its invasion of another country using conventional forces. Most major states would today be expected to use cyberwarfare to attack another country's computer infrastructure as part of an invasion or aggression. Cyberwarfare tends to be distinguished from other forms of hostile cyber activity. Cybercrime involves activities like raiding bank accounts. Cyber espionage describes the stealing of secrets. Cyberwarfare tends to describe an assault that affects the national security of the state that is victimised.  ExampleThere are a number of hard examples of cyberwarfare in action. The attack on Estonia's internet system in 2007 by the Russian state -or its proxies - is one example. [1] In 2010, there was the deployment of the Stuxnet worm, widely believed to have been used by the US and Israel to attack computer-controlled centrifuges at a uranium enrichment facility in Iran which disrupted the country's nuclear programme.

cyclically adjusted PE ratio - Shiller PE - CAPE,"A cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio, otherwise known as the CAPE, or Shiller PE after Robert Shiller, who popularised it, measures the price of a company's stock relative to average earnings over the past 10 years. Its raw form   originally used for individual stocks by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd   was modified by Prof Shiller to adjust for inflation. The Shiller PE aims to smooth out the economic and profit cycles to give a more informed view of a company's price than the traditional price earnings ratio, which uses only one year of profits. The traditional P/E ratio compares the share price to either the past year's earnings or forecast earnings, typically for the next 12 months. The smoothing achieved by looking at earnings over a 10-year period avoids concluding a market is cheap or expensive based on unsustainable one-year swings in profits, either up or down. But critics point out the choice of a 10-year period is arbitrary, and neither the economic nor profit cycles follow neat 10-year patterns. Many also question the use of data provided by Prof Shiller for profits back to the late 19th century, arguing that changes to accounting standards - as well as varying enforcement of the rules - makes them hard to compare.[1]     cyclically adjusted PE (CAPE) ratio in the news In May 2013 it was reported that stock markets in southern Europe were beginning to attract the attention of hedge funds due to their low cyclically adjusted PE ratios. The US market looks either at, or over, long term valuations, depending where you take your starting point. Spain's stock market was on a Shiller earnings multiple of 8.9   less than half its long-run valuation of 20.8. In September 2013 an FT analysis looked at the clash of opinions between Robert Shiller and another renowed economist, Jeremy Siegel. According to Prof Shiller US equities were very overvalued whereas Prof Siegel argued the data on which CAPE relies were unreliable. His own model showed US stocks to be undervalued."

dark pools,"A dark pool  is the romantic   or sinister, depending on your viewpoint   name given to a network that allows traders to buy or sell large orders without running the risk that other traders will work out what is going on and put the price up, or down, to take advantage of the order. They have been criticised for their lack of transparency and because the inevitable fragmentation of trading could lead to less efficient pricing in traditional open stock exchanges. [1]    In dark pools, pre-trade prices   the price at which shares are offered for sale   are not visible to anyone, even the participants in them, and the price at which shares change hands is only revealed after the trade is done. [2]     the purpose of dark pools The primary purpose of dark pools is to minimise market impact. By restricting access to undesired market participants (such as high frequency trading firms), and by not revealing quotes, dark pools enable institutional investors to minimise their information leakage and realise more efficient executions. More specifically, dark trading facilities provide the possibility of price improvement and reduced transaction costs by crossing orders at the midpoint of the quoted best bid and offer prices, thereby saving on both the bid-offer spread and on exchange fees. For these reasons, dark pools have been popular for the execution of large block orders.[3]   the prevalence of dark pools At the beginning of 2013 it was estimated that non-displayed trading accounted for a third of total volume in the US and dark pools about 13 per cent of total volume. A similar volume was said to be taking place in Europe. Rapid growth had been noted of about 50 per cent over the preceding three years in the US, while in Europe, trading in dark pools relative to order-book activity had more than doubled over the preceding two years.[4]   why trading in dark pools has been growing Dark pools have become prevalent due to technological developments that have lowered costs allowing broker/dealers to route more of the order flow they handle to their own private pools first before sending unwanted orders to the public markets.[5]                    dark pools in the news In the US in April 2013, chief executives of NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and BATS Global Markets argued for regulators to introduce rules permitting transactions to only take place away from a public exchange if a customer is getting a much-improved price. They pointed to similar steps taken by Canadian and Australian regulators to combat the rise of off exchange trading, otherwise known as dark pools. In June 2014, New York's top securities regulator sued Barclays for allegedly favouring high speed traders in its ""dark pool"". The complaint was set to increase the pressure on other dark pool operators such as those run by Credit Suisse, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to provide investors with more information about how they operate. In recent months, some dark pools had begun voluntarily publishing more information on how they work."

data privacy,"Data privacy, or information privacy, concerns the collection, protection and dissemination of personal or private information about individuals or organisations. While legal standards protecting data privacy vary greatly around the world there are some accepted norms, such as the right to cast a vote in a national election without being identified. Many developed nations have adopted specific legislation that relates to privacy in certain parts of public life, such as a person's healthcare records. The increasing scope of the internet has raised many new data privacy issues.   data privacy in the news Data privacy became big news In May 2013 when a former employee of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and former contractor for the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, leaked thousands of classified documents to several media outlets. In May 2014, Google lost a landmark case over the limits of data privacy in Europe, leaving it obliged to remove personal information appearing on its search engines under certain circumstances. Essentially the ruling meant that individuals could request the erasure of information about them displayed on Google search engines. The case was brought by a Costeja Gonzalez, a Spanish national, who asked Google to delete links relating to a time when his house was being auctioned because he failed to pay taxes. Google had argued that it was not responsible for information published legally elsewhere.               "

data-driven marketing,"Data-driven marketing refers to the marketing insights and decisions that arise from the analysis of data about or from consumers.  The data may be secondary, for example, tracking online social interactions, web browsing behaviour, online search behaviour, or primary such as data collected directly by surveying consumers.With the advent of online consumer panels and resources such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and online survey design tools, such as SurveyMonkey and Qualtrics, companies are able to collect input from hundreds or thousands of consumers within hours and with a very limited budget.ExampleOne popular tool for measuring consumer preferences for specific features of products or services is conjoint analysis.  This is a questionnaire asking consumers to react to various hypothetical products or services defined as  bundles  of attributes.Statistical regression analysis then provides numerical estimates of the value placed by each respondent on each of these attributes. These estimates may be used to forecast market shares for various hypothetical products, to compute the premium that may be charged for various features, and to design products and services that will maximize the company s profit.A rigorous conjoint analysis survey with a representative and significant sample of consumers may now be administered and analyzed in a very limited time, for example in less than a few days and with a very limited budget such as less than a few hundred US dollars.

death spiral (costing-based),"Some of an entity's overhead costs are either fixed (in that they remain the same irrespective of the volume of production or service-providing activity) or are semi-variable (in that a portion of the cost is fixed).  Eliminating a product or service can increase the overhead rate used to cost products or services because these fixed or semi-variable costs (the numerator in the overhead rate) remain the same or decrease more slowly than the cost allocation base (the denominator), which is often related to the expected number of products or services offered. The higher overhead rate increases the overhead costed to remaining products or services. If any products or services are subsequently eliminated, the burden rate may increase again.  In theory, the product eliminations and the subsequent increases in the overhead rates could continue until all products become too expensive and are therefore eliminated, resulting in no products left to sell. Example Suppose an airline cancelled a route out of an airport.  The remaining fixed and semi-variable costs associated with maintaining gates at the airport would be allocated to the routes still offered.  If any of those routes became too expensive, they are cancelled, and the remaining fixed and semi-variable costs are re-allocated to the remaining routes at the airport, in theory until a point where the airline no longer offers flights at that airport.

decision analysis,"The term decision analysis was coined in 1964 by Ronald A. Howard, professor of management science and engineering at Stanford University. Decision analysis refers to a systematic, quantitative and interactive approach to addressing and evaluating important choices confronted by organisations in the private and public sector. Decision analysis is interdisciplinary and draws on theories from the fields of psychology, economics, and management science. It utilises a variety of tools which include models for decision-making under conditions of uncertainty or multiple objectives; techniques of risk analysis and risk assessment; experimental and descriptive studies of decision-making behaviour; economic analysis of competitive and strategic decisions; techniques for facilitating decision-making by groups; and computer modeling software and expert systems for decision support.   an example of decision analysis in use Decision analysis (DA) has been applied to business problems in management, marketing, operations, accounting, and finance. In addition, it has had an impact on the fields of medicine, law, military science, environmental sciences, and public policy more generally. In 2010, Chevron won the Decision Analysis Society Practice Award for its use of DA in determining whether or not to invest in Gorgon, a multi-billion dollar capital investment project in Australia, involving one of the largest natural gas developments in the world.[1]   decision analysis in the news In a 2004 piece focused on enterprise risk management a professor of decision sciences at Insead explained that decision analysis is one of the techniques used in risk modelling."

In this way, asset managers spent some time, particularly in the aftermath of the financial crisis, arguing that emerging markets were decoupling from more mature markets and could expect buoyant returns even when developed markets were experiencing declines. The idea was that emerging markets would better reflect the attractive characteristics of their home countries with favourable demographics, little or no debt and fast economic growth. As time went on, however, it became clear that the fortunes of emerging markets were still strongly linked to the economic fortunes of developed countries.   decoupling in the news In August 2013 an FT columnist argued the emerging market decoupling story had always been over-hyped. He wrote that since the US Fed had started talk of tapering, cutting back its asset purchase programme, that the emerging market independent growth story had become tarnished. "

The use of default solutions is often the result of accepting the problem framing (how the problem is described) that has been given. Example When it is necessary to control material costs, the default solution is often to work various aspects of the economic order quantity (EOQ) calculation to better balance holding/ storage costs with the risks of stockouts (not having certain goods in stock).  EOQ is the ideal amount of goods to order at one time in a cost efficient way, considering all related costs such as delivery and storage of goods.

defined contribution plan,"An employer-sponsored qualified retirement plan, a defined contribution (DC) plan allows employees to defer a portion of salary. The funds receive beneficial tax treatment and are placed into an individual account for each participant. The money is invested in mutual funds or individual stocks on behalf of the employee. With such plans, employers traditionally will match a portion of the employee s contribution or contribute an amount equal to a percentage of the employee s salary. Employees bear the investment risk and can typically guide the selection of investments within set parameters. The contributions, plus or minus any investment gains, are used to fund a portion of the individual s retirement. In the U.S., prime examples of DC plans are 401(k) plans and 403(b) plans. [1]"

Instead, it relates to how the funds in the plan have been invested and the return on that investment.

Companies like them better than defined-benefit pension plans because the pension outlay is gradual and controlled and liability for investment performance is passed onto the employee."

deflation,"A sustained fall in the prices of goods and services, and thus the opposite of inflation. Not to be confused with disinflation, which is a slowing down of price rises (a fall in the inflation rate). Deflation may be the result of government policy (such as a move to raise interest rates and cut money supply) or can be caused by external factors, such as intense trade competition or the collapse of an asset bubble. Deflation may have short-term benefits, particularly if it is the result of greater efficiencies in the economy, but if it lasts too long, or if it is the result of weakening demand, it can be a negative, self-perpetuating influence on economic activity, discouraging consumption, reducing revenue and wage levels, pushing up bad debts and increasing the rate of bankruptcy. The combination of deflation and a sustained drop in economic output is termed an economic depression. Also see recession.   deflation in the news In April 2014 an FT writer argued that for Japan to really rise above its decade of deflation it would need to start awarding higher wages to workers. However, Japan's recovery had thus far not been visible in overall wage data. Meanwhile, in the same month, deflation was looming in the eurozone. A struggle was emerging in the Eurozone over whether the European Central Bank could counter the threat of deflation with a European version of quantitative easing   a course of action viewed with deep suspicion in Germany.

design attitude,"The design attitude contrasts with or compliments a decision attitude. The decision attitude operates from the assumption that, in managing, the difficult task to be performed is to select among alternatives. A design attitude assumes, instead, that the real challenge is often to generate better alternatives. In an analysis of designers, Kamil Michlewski identified the qualities associated with a design attitude. They included empathy, a willingness to embrace ambiguity, the desire to engage and use one s senses to learn, explore and express oneself, an appreciation for the way that complex things have qualities that go beyond their parts, and an interest in actually making things. His results were published in the 2008 Organizations Studies article Uncovering Design Attitude: Inside the Culture of Designers. Example The shift from a decision to a design attitude can be seen in the treatment of the classic inventory control problem. This is the process of ensuring that the amount of raw materials and finished products are being managed efficiently to meet demand. To solve the inventory problem, the decision-oriented approach would create buffers so that at any given point there would be a surplus of supply to meet the most likely levels of demand. For thirty years, research and teaching extended and refined this model. As a consequence, we were blinded for decades to the possibility that inventories (unsold goods and raw materials) could be minimised by other means, such as rethinking the design of the production system, such as using just-in-time (JIT) inventories (having the right goods in stock just before they are required to reduce storage costs). [1]"
design brief,A set of instructions about what a new product should look like or what features it should have. [1] 
design thinking,"At the beginning of the 20th century design was principally about communication (graphic design) and artifacts (industrial design). As the century drew to a close, more and more designers were working on the design of interactions, often, but not always, involving computers and other systems. Recently design skills have been applied to solving problems at the level of organisations and society. In response to the need for a new term to describe these broader applications of design some have used the phrase  design thinking . It is meant to suggest that while many of the skills that designers have developed are relevant, the problems are not within their exclusive area as traditionally defined. Some people have issues with the phrase in that it de-emphasises the important making aspect of design, reducing it to a cognitive process. Among other things, design thinking calls for reframing problems (how the problem is described) to find solutions that others have overlooked. Example In the 1950s, most people who were trying to speed up oceanic shipping were focused on the time it took to move cargo across the ocean. By improving the ship s engines or the shape of its hull they were sometimes able to take hours or days off for each crossing. Malcolm McLean, owner of a trucking company, recast the problem to focus on the time it took to move cargo on and off ships. His innovation, container shipping, eventually reduced cargo s total time in transit by weeks rather than hours or days. [1]"

digital dividend,"The switchover from analogue to digital terrestrial television (DTT), expected to be completed in Europe by the end of 2012, will free up a large amount of radiofrequency spectrum. For the same number of broadcast television programs, only a fraction   about one quarter to one tenth depending on the level of compression and standard   of the spectrum is required by DTT. This is known as the  Digital Dividend : for the same number of television channels, less spectrum is needed and the respective frequencies can be made available for other uses, such as mobile telephony. This spectrum offers a unique opportunity to meet new demands for services and to support the European agenda for innovation. Most importantly, it could have a significant impact on the EU economy, driving innovation, job growth, productivity and competitiveness. What is key is how the  Digital Dividend  will be allocated. Governments should resist the temptation to please broadcasters and let them have this dividend for nothing. Instead they should let the market decide, possibly via auction mechanism. It is likely that it will end up in the hands of operators supplying new wireless communications services. This would be far more beneficial for the EU economy because the contribution to productivity and GDP from investment in telecoms and especially mobile is much greater than anything else, as confirmed by a range of economic modelling studies. Example Italy completed the latest round of spectrum auctions in September 2011, which included the sale of licences in the 800-MHz  digital dividend  frequencies. The auction brought in some EUR 4 billion (USD 5.4 billion), paid by cellular operators who will use these frequencies, previously allocated to analogue TV, to deploy the new generation of high-speed mobile communications (4G). [1]"
digital marketing,"The marketing of products or services using digital channels to reach consumers. The key objective is to promote brands through various forms of digital media. Digital marketing extends beyond internet marketing to include channels that do not require the use of the internet. It includes mobile phones (both SMS and MMS), social media marketing, display advertising, search engine marketing, and any other form of digital media. Most experts believe that 'digital' is not just yet another channel for marketing. It requires a new approach to marketing and a new understanding of customer behaviour. For example, it requires companies to analyse and quantify the value of downloads of apps on mobile devices, tweets on Twitter, likes on Facebook and so on. Example One successful digital media campaign was by Pizza Hut, which created an app that allowed customers to create their own pizza by dragging their chosen toppings onto a graphical pizza base. The iPhone would then determine which of the chain's thousands of locations the customer happened to be nearest. The company advertised the new app online, in print, and on television - even winning a placement in Apple's own iPhone commercial. Within two weeks, the Pizza Hut app was downloaded 100,000 times and within three months iPhone users ordered $1m worth of pizza. The app now has millions of users across the iPhone, iPad, and Android platforms. [1]"

diluted market capitalisation,"Diluted market capitalisation is the total market value of a company's outstanding shares factoring in the impact of dilutive securities such as options, restricted stock units and convertible securities. It is calculated by multiplying a company's diluted shares outstanding by the current market price for one share. While market cap (also known as equity value and market value) is often used in the finance world, a more thorough analysis factors in the impact of potential shares   that is, securities that are currently not in the share count, but could become shares in the future. The impact of potential dilutive securities such as options given to employees as compensation can be large. A case in point is Twitter. At the $45.10 opening price after its November 2013 intitial public offering and based on 555m shares outstanding, many people would say Twitter had a $25bn market capitalisation ($45.10 x 555m   $25bn). However, factoring in 149m potential shares from securities such as options and restricted stock units granted to employees, Twitter has approximately 704m diluted shares giving it a diluted market capitalisation of $32bn ($45.10 x 704m). A smart investor factors in all potential dilutive securities, so a more thorough analysis focuses on the $32bn number.[1]"

Dim sum is a form of Chinese food served in small bite-sized portions.    dim sum bonds in the news In February 2013 it was reported that appetite had returned for dim sum bonds. The market had underperformed in 2012 because the renminbi dropped 1.6 per cent against the US dollar between March and July shattering assumptions that it would inexorably rise due to being undervalued. The fall in the renminbi led to subdued interest in the dim sum bond market as many investors had been using the bonds as a currency play. By February 2013, the renminbi had risen to a fresh high against the US dollar and although expectations for further appreciation in 2013 looked muted there was renewed enthusiasm for investment in China. Renminbi bond prices rose and yields had fallen to 4.1 per cent from 4.6 per cent in December."

direct price discrimination,"Pricing strategy that charges different prices relative to costs according to buyer s type for the same good or service.  It is designed to elicit higher profit margins from buyers with higher willingness to pay. By using direct price discrimination, the seller can raise profit.  However, if the discrimination is not precise, the seller might lose some sales by setting a price above the customer s willingness to pay.  Direct price discrimination requires detailed information about each customer segment s willingness to pay. Example For instance, cinemas charge higher prices to adults than children as adults tend to have a decent level of disposable income.

The legislation currently applies to income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, stamp duty land tax, stamp duty reserve tax, the annual tax on enveloped dwellings and national insurance contributions. In broad terms, it applies where there are arrangements which generate a tax advantage and where the arrangements fall within one or more specific hallmarks.

discontinuous innovation,"Discontinuous innovations cause a paradigm shift in science or technology and/or the market structure of an industry. As they are entirely new-to-the world products, made to perform a function for which no product has previously existed, discontinuous innovation requires a good deal of learning for the incumbent organisation and its value network, including the user. Discontinuous innovations disrupt established routine and may even require a very different set of capabilities and new behaviour patterns. The notion of novelty is relative so a discontinuous innovation for one organisation might be an incremental one for another. Radical innovation and discontinuous innovation are synonyms. Disruptive innovation used to be a synonym until 1997. Since then the term has been strongly associated with Christensen s model. Incremental innovation is the opposite of radical innovation. [1] "

discovery-driven business planning,"Discovery-driven business planning is a method of analysing the economic feasibility of new business ventures. Professors Rita G. McGrath and Ian C. MacMillan introduced the method in their Harvard Business Review article in 1995. Before discovery-driven planning, entrepreneurs or managers focused primarily on conventional business planning whereby they calculated how much profit a new venture could earn if it achieved the targeted growth rate in the future, which inevitably turned out to be inaccurate following the venture s launch.  Discovery-driven planning turns this process on its head: the analysis focuses on figuring out what costs the venture can afford to incur in order to reach pre-specified financial goals, by generating a  reverse income statement .  In this process, one asks:  If the new venture needs to bring in a certain amount of revenues and profits, how many customers should it serve, and what would it cost to serve those customers   If the allowable costs, benchmarked with real data, are smaller than required revenues, the new venture appears to be feasible, and the next phase of discovery driven-planning can begin.  The second phase of discovery-driven planning involves creating a roadmap of the practical steps that need to be taken in order to test the important cost- and revenue-related assumptions made while building the reverse income statement. Each industry has its own key performance indicators which impact costs and revenues (such as the customer retention rate or the production yield rate). The practical steps to test these key performance indicators are scheduled as early as possible during the rollout of the new venture s products and services. Building a prototype product, pre-launch user testing and measuring customer response (purchase / no purchase, repeat / abandon) will help entrepreneurs to figure out whether the venture is able to meet or exceed its benchmarks. The third phase of discovery planning involves carrying out sensitivity analyses. For example, what would happen if the number of units that can be sold at the target market price turns out to be 20 per cent lower in reality   Or, what if the customer retention rate is only half as high  Using simulation software, the entrepreneur can explore whether such scenarios would put the economic feasibility of the venture in jeopardy. In this process, the most important cost and revenue assumptions also become apparent: they are the ones where small discrepancies relative to the targets would result in the greatest damage to profits.

An FT writer commented that the most dangerous period, so far as investors are concerned, is just before deflation strikes which is when shares tend to plunge in anticipation.

dispersion,"Dispersion is a term used in equities markets to refer to the gap between the best and the worst stocks. It is of great interest to stock pickers because the greater the dispersion the better those who make the right calls will look. For example, during the crash of 2007-2008, correlation was high, as all stocks fell at once, but returns were highly dispersed   banks did far worse than the rest as they led the market down. Therefore, those who avoided bank stocks, or sold them short, showed superior performance, even in an environment of high correlation.   dispersion in the news In December 2013 an FT writer commented on research by S&P; Indices which had found that dispersion was correlated with volatility. As volatility levels were low, all stocks were moving in a close range of one another which meant there were fewer opportunities for out-performance.                "

disposition effect,"The tendency of investors to hold losers too long and sell winners too soon. Investors are willing to realise gains but are reluctant to realise losses. The effect is observed in experiments and over different investor types, time periods, asset classes, and countries. It is considered an irrational behavior, because selling and holding decisions should depend on the perceived future value of a security, but not the purchase price. Some studies have documented that stocks investors sell due to the disposition effect (winners) outperform those they hold (losers); this means that investors would be better off by holding winners for longer and selling losers sooner. The disposition effect is shown to be inconsistent with explanations based on information, rebalancing, or tax considerations. [1]"

disrupt,"To prevent a situation, event, system etc from working in the normal way. [1] "
disruption,"Being  disruptive , when expressed by a start-up s founder, refers to the act of forcing one s way into a niche, bludgeoning the existing competition with a new method of delivering a service and generally injecting greater efficiency into something people have done or used since time immemorial. In this sense, the word  disruption  can be paired with any industry and the start-up team will sound plausible, such has been the effect of the internet in scaring corporate bosses in even the most low tech of businesses.   disruption in the news Disruption fits an age where the internet is changing everything, from the way we shop   Asos has disrupted high street fashion, for instance   to how we move around, as in the case of Zipcar and Uber s disruption of the car and taxi markets. The worldwide web is the ultimate disruptive change in this context. While this may all sound great, a problem arises when it seems every start-up is using the word to describe what it does. [1]"
disruptive innovation,"A term linked to entrepreneurship. In pitching an idea, entrepreneurs often describe their products and services as disruptive. This term comes from Clayton Christensen s writing on the challenges big companies face in developing new ideas. Christensen s argument is that large incumbent companies are focused on delivering value to their existing customers and  thus do not always pursue innovations that could potentially attract new customers. This gap presents an opportunity for entrepreneurs to develop products and services that meet this unsatisfied demand and upend the competitive structure of the entire industry. Disruptive innovation can come in the form of: - novel organisational practices like Nucor s pay-for-performance schemes - new business models like Southwest s low-cost approach to flying - cutting edge technologies like Intuitive s Da Vinci surgical robot. For entrepreneurs, market research that gauges the interest of 'latent' customers, who are not yet participating in a market, can be especially valuable in developing disruptive innovation. Disruptive products need not be high tech; Nintendo s Wii was a low-tech game console with intuitive controls and great gameplay that drew in younger gamers and brought back older aficionados who grew up with Super Mario.

distributed denial of service DDoS,"A distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack uses many computers and many internet connections to flood a targeted server or network resource with requests, or packets of information, rendering it unavailable to users, or in come cases crashing the network. A DDoS attack differs from a denial service (DoS) attack which uses just one computer and one internet connection to flood a targeted server.   DDoS in the news In March 2013 it was reported that hackers had hit a European anti-spam group with a cyber attack so large that experts said it could slow down the whole internet. According to security companies monitoring the attack, it had risen in scale from 10 gigabits per second of data to 300Gbps, making it one of the largest of its kind and about six times the size of most such incidents. Cloudflare, a security company hired by Spamhaus   which had been subject to large-scale DDoS attacks   to fight off the bombardment, said the attack ceased on March 21 but resumed the next day with increased power, targeting Cloudflare s network providers in an effort to neutralise the defence."

diverse teams,"With increasing globalisation, many organisations face tougher competition at the same time they are working in a more complex environment, needing to coordinate geographically dispersed operations and a cross-cultural workforce. This leads to diverse teams becoming more common at all levels of the organisation. Diversity can be based on various characteristics such as gender, age, nationality, ethnic and/ or cultural group etc, or on indicators of cognitive diversity such as international experience, education, industry and work experience that can all lead to different perspectives. Research shows that diversity results in better performance on complex decisions and problems, just the type of challenges faced by global firms. Also, diversity has a bigger impact on organisations with greater managerial discretion such as the high-tech sector or when undertaking new initiatives. Diversity is increasingly necessary for working globally, to ensure a global mindset, and for long-term cultural agility. In much of the literature, diversity is seen as balancing the tendency for homogenous groups to think in similar ways. If differing views can be combined in problem-solving or decision-making, the outcome is usually better than that of a single view, this is the synergy of working with diverse groups. However, diverse teams can also experience their differences as barriers to communication, so that reaching a common understanding or outcome takes more time and effort, and raises the transaction costs of teamwork. Many studies assume that a global mindset, often defined as openness and global knowledge, is key to executives and organisations succeeding in a highly interlinked world. Example In 2011, Nokia s leadership group is an example of a diverse team of thirteen members.  This includes three women, one non-white, six Finns, four Americans, one Canadian, one British and one Australian. Three were born in the  50s, one in the 70 s and the rest in the  60s. Their work experience covers Europe, North American and East Asia and their educational backgrounds include engineering, technology, psychology, law, economics and finance from a variety of institutions while the team members represent many functions. It remains to be seen whether they can make successful decisions that profit from their diverse perspectives and experiences without getting into the conflicts that can arise when people have different assumptions about how things work.

diversity management,"Company initiatives undertaken to include all employees in company programmes and informal social networks. Organisations seeking global relevance cannot ignore the impact of workforce diversity on their ability to problem-solve, innovate, and cultivate diverse markets. Diversity management goes far beyond simply hiring demographically diverse employees. It encompasses everything a company does that signals its genuine attitude toward employees  diverse perspectives and backgrounds. Company programmes and processes, as well as managers  behaviour, create a palpable climate around diversity, so that employees develop a strong sense of whether or not it is truly acceptable for them to bring their full selves to work. Without diversity management, managers and employees may unthinkingly act on prejudices and feel threatened by differences among employees. Diversity management is intended to foster appreciation for the diverse ideas and personal histories that employees bring to the workplace. When employees value each others  diversity and learn to connect and communicate across lines of difference, employees feel safe sharing their distinctive ideas, which fuel innovation. Diversity management is also crucial for sustainable business growth because the increasingly diverse public evaluates organisations on their diversity management. If an organisation is found to be culturally insensitive, its ethics and ability to function in the global marketplace will be called into question. Example IBM has embraced diversity management as an essential strategy for running its business and expanding its global presence. Its leaders have crafted diverse teams that understand local markets, and promoted the appreciation of diversity broadly defined within IBM s employee communities. These attempts to cultivate a positive diversity climate have helped IBM to continue driving innovation. [1]"

donation based crowdfunding,"Donation-based crowdfunding plays a crucial role in the new wave of alternative finance and the future of our economy. It enables individuals to directly share their money with causes and projects that they feel strongly about and thereby empower others to create impact. This form of crowdfunding essentially involves backers donating varying sums of money to support a specific cause or project. Sometimes they will receive a simple ""thank you"" or a special mention   or even a physical item such as a postcard   however, the pledge is essentially a donation. This model differs from reward-based crowdfunding which is generally applied to the financing of new products, and provides an item with a clear monetary value in exchange for a pledge. Donation-based crowdfunding was established long before equity-based crowdfunding, where the donor invests money in return for equity in the venture (e.g. CrowdCube) and credit-based crowdfunding, also known as peer-to-peer lending, where an investor will expect a financial return with interest (e.g. Funding Circle). The donation-based crowdfunding model is changing the face of education. Not only is it being added to the curriculum of many business schools, it is also providing vital additional funds for student fees (e.g. StudentFunder) and projects at both universities and schools (e.g. hubbub.net codeclub.co.uk). Only 1 per cent of all existing university alumni fundraising is done online, but around  882m is donated to UK universities by alumni. Donation-based crowdfunding makes alumni giving more efficient, transparent and social, so the opportunity to increase both the amount given, and the amount given online, is significant.[1]  "

double Irish,"The double Irish, exploited by Google, Microsoft and Facebook, is the most controversial tax loophole. It allows multinationals that use Ireland as a foreign operating base to avoid its modest 12.5 per cent corporation tax. Profits are instead routed to a subsidiary in Bermuda. It depends on Ireland s permissive view that an Irish-registered business should be taxed where it is managed, even if that is an island where shorts are business attire. This irritates the US government, which would like its cut of the $1tn US companies have parked offshore, and the EU member states where the likes of Google make substantial sales booked in Ireland. But the double Irish has been a covert competitive advantage for the erstwhile Celtic tiger.   double Irish in the news To appease EU competition regulators, Ireland capitulated in its October budget and announced a phasing out of the loophole by 2020. This gives tax advisers time to dream up replacement schemes. Tax ruses come and go   the double Irish, for example, was once accompanied by a manoeuvre known as the  Dutch sandwich . What never changes is the opportunity for avoidance that is created by the differences between national systems. The willingness of governments to lure footloose businesses with tax breaks is another constant.

The best known example of e-money is the Bitcoin, which can be bought with real money and traded on an exchange like any other currency.   e-money in the news In June 2013 the FT's Alphaville returned to a growing debate about whether digital e-money should be added to central banks toolkits. Economists have pointed out that it would be a logical step to introduce e-money in a zero or negative rate environment. The ability to convert deposits into banknotes during a period of negative rates represents something of a monetary loophole. If negative rates were introduced, one could consequently expect a marked shift from bank reserves being the primary interface between the central bank and the money supply, to banknotes. The introduction of e-money would encourage the velocity of money and bring back seigniorage revenue to the government."

"earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation","Ebitda stands for earnings  before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation. Investors rely on Ebitda as a measure of operating cash flow because it excludes non-cash charges of depreciation and amortisation. Because Ebitda does not include interest or tax expense, it allows comparability across companies without distortions from capital structure and tax rates. A common valuation technique is comparing the ratio of enterprise value/Ebitda. Ebitda is not a pure measure of cash flow because it does not account for changes in working capital or capital expenditures and cash interest expense and cash taxes. Ebitda often excludes one-off restructuring charges. Analysts sometimes also use Ebitdar (earnings before interest, tax depreciation, amortisation and rent), which is useful for removing costs likely to be due to a different mix of operating leases. Ebitda is generally seen to be more illuminating than using a simple price earnings ratio as a guide to value, because PE doesn't work for companies that are making a loss. Likewise, a price to sales ratio gives a measure of what revenues are worth, but is not useful in a fast-growing company. Enterprise value to revenue is also sometimes used in companies where analysts wish to take debt into account.   ebitda in the news At the beginning of October 2013, Twitter filed a prospectus ahead of its initial public offering. Unusually, it used the term ""adjusted Ebitda"" which it defined as net loss adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortisation expense, interest and other expenses and provision (benefit) for income taxes. An FT writer commented that this meant it was basically excluding a chunk of worker compensation paid in shares, thereby flattering the figures. In the first six months of 2013, Twitter workers were paid $35m in shares and the company made $21m in adjusted Ebidta."
earnings conference call,"An earnings conference call is a teleconference where public company officials discuss reported financial performance and provide future performance projections. Earnings conference calls follow shortly after the quarterly earnings press release.   Typically the chief executive officer and chief financial officer will offer introductory remarks during the presentation portion of the call, and then take questions from sell-side financial analysts and other market participants during a question and answer session.  Corporate management decides who they will take questions from.  Calls typically last one hour, with the length depending on the size of the firm, the nature of the deviation of reported quarterly earnings from expected earnings, and the economic conditions surrounding the firm. [1]   earnings conference call in the news In January 2013, an earnings conference call associated with IBM's fourth-quarter results revealed that analysts welcomed margin improvements, but they also questioned whether revenues could return to growth in 2013. In March 2011, a report on research by the[2] author of this definition, Bill Mayew, and his fellow professor at Fuqua School of Business, Mohan Venkatachalam, revealed they had discovered that the tone of the voices of executives during earnings conference calls was correlated with future stock market performance."
earnings differential,A difference in the pay of two jobs that is supposed to show their relative importance. [1] 
earnings management,"Financial reporting requires management to make estimates about future benefits and obligations. For example, management is required to estimate the fraction of credit sales for which cash is unlikely to be collected in the future (i.e., provisioning for bad and doubtful debts). Accountants have also developed different methods of accounting for the same activity. For example, a variety of approaches to valuing inventory are available to management including FIFO, weighted average, units of production (and in some jurisdictions LIFO). The requirement to make estimates and the ability to choose between different accounting procedures provides management with the ability to influence financial reporting outcomes. For example, management may select a particular accounting treatment that leads to higher reported income or they may make estimates that affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Earnings management is the generic term given to accounting decisions that influence financial reporting outcomes. The term is something of a misnomer in so far as reported earnings may not be the primary target: in some situations management may be more interested in reducing levels of gearing (leverage) or boosting return on investment metrics.   The term tends to be used pejoratively in the sense that it implies an attempt to mislead or obfuscate. History is littered with instances where management have used their financial reporting discretion to camouflage poor performance (e.g., Maxwell Corporation) or create the illusion of spectacular growth (e.g., Enron). Research reveals that groups manipulate financial reporting outcomes in response to a wide range of factors including capital market pressures for superior growth, the desire to meet or beat analysts  consensus earnings forecasts, incentives to maximise compensation tied to earnings outcomes, avoiding debt covenant violation, and influencing regulatory outcomes. Note that while shareholders may lose out from earnings management in some of these situations (e.g., when management attempt to hide poor performance) they may gain in other circumstances (e.g., in the case where the firm achieves a favourable regulatory outcome). Discretion over financial reporting decisions is integral to the accounting process and helps management convey a more accurate picture of performance and financial position. Research demonstrates that on average reported earnings provides more information about value and changes in value than raw cash flow. In spite of all the opportunities to manipulate reported outcomes and mislead users, the accounting process appears to add value. Eradicating all opportunities for earnings management is not an option for regulators therefore because it risks throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Consequently, regulators and users of accounting information have to accept a limited of risk of manipulation in pursuit of more informative financial reporting. [1]"
earnings momentum,A trend of accelerating growth in earnings per share.
earnings per share  EPS,"Profit, net of tax and dividends to preferred shareholders, divided by the total amount of ordinary shares outstanding. In the US, companies report basic earnings per share (which does not include stock options, warrants and convertibles), and fully diluted earnings per share (which does). Most income statements include a calculation of earnings per share. This calculation tells you how much money shareholders would receive for each share of stock they own if the company distributed all of its net income for the period. In reality, however, companies would not distribute all of their earnings. Usually they reinvest them in the business. It is possible to view a calculation of a company's earnings per share by clicking on the hyperlinked company's name in an FT story about them. Or you can find the same information by visiting the FT's markets data section.                             Earnings per share EPS in the news In May 2014 an FT columnist reported on the shrinking S&P; 500. Net issuance of US stock had been negative for 46 months as companies bought back stock. This was welcomed by shareholders. Buybacks reduce the amount of stock in issue. This boosts earnings per share by reducing the number of shares and acts as a prop to the market. The ever rising value of the S&P;, and the ever shrinking number of shares held in the companies it represents, are linked phenomena. But the phenomenon was criticised by politicians who would have preferred companies to invest rather than spend their money on buybacks."

econometrics,"Econometrics is the art and science of using data to test various economic theories. More specifically, econometrics can be viewed as the use of mathematics and sophisticated statistical modelling to test economic or financial theories as well as forecast the effects of changes in economic or financial factors under various scenarios. Although econometric techniques are widely used in economic and financial analyses by both financial practitioners and academics, there is not one generally accepted definition of the term.  Econometrics is an inter-disciplinary effort to understand economic and financial behaviour through the use of data, economic theory, mathematics, statistical methods, and other quantitative techniques.  Example The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial theory developed in the 1960s and posits a linear relationship between the return on a firm's stock and the return on the market portfolio (i.e., the weighted average return on all marketable securities available to an investor).  This theory can be tested using econometric techniques such as ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis in order to verify if indeed a firm s stock returns can be explained by movements in the returns on a market portfolio.  In this case, the analyst must obtain data on the returns to the stock and the market portfolio, as well as define what should be the appropriate proxy for the market portfolio (e.g., the FTSE-100 Index or the S&P; 500 index).  Statistical software systems can then use these data to estimate an OLS regression and compute statistics which, in turn, can be examined by a quantitative analyst or economist to determine whether the CAPM theory is supported for this stock.[1] View Article: Can we predict a financial crisis  Does it matter "

economic globalisation,"Economic globalisation has two main elements: the mobility of goods, services, capital, technology, and people in the world economy as a whole; and a given country s integration into the world economy. In the 19th century in the world economy as a whole, capital and people, but not goods, tended to cross borders easily; in the 21st century; world economy, goods, capital, and technologies, but not people, crossed borders relatively easily. The member countries of the European Union have gone further than any others in opening their economies to labour, capital, goods, and services within the bloc. The few surviving relics of the Soviet model   North Korea and Cuba  in particular   are among the world s most isolated and autarkic countries.  A country s integration into the global economy generally brings increased national wealth, but globalisation is at least initially frequently associated with increased inequality.

EI is closely linked to knowledge management and to human resources, because people have explicit and implicit knowledge that will be revealed only if reliable processes and real motivation exist in the organisation. For all international players, be they states, big firms, or non-state organisations, EI is a tool for competition as well as a tool for governance and for national security. The ultimate goal of EI and knowledge management is to produce added value, in two steps: transform information into knowledge and knowledge into sustainable added value. The EI concept gathers several other concepts and practices: competitive intelligence, economic security, risk management, lobbying, public diplomacy, soft power (governments), business diplomacy (companies).

economic security,"This can refer to states as well as to private companies. At first view, the term 'economic security' seems to be a contradiction in itself in liberal economies, since capitalism is based on insecurity. It refers to doctrines and policies, consisting in preventing and avoiding disruptions in the life of firms or, more often, of states.  As our globalisation is firstly an economic process, it is understandable that security has shifted from the military to the economic. Economic security takes particularly into account the new risks occurring from the combination of the globalised competition and the incredible new role of information, for example threats on data, attacks on public research centres, attacks from financial predators against state currencies (like in UK by George Soros in 1992, at a time when capacities of information were even less developed), stock market manipulations, etc... And States build up new legal tools in order to protect their economies from predators, such as the US CFIUS since 1975 or in France, a minimum version in 2005. The question is to reach an acceptable balance between security and protectionism. [1] "

economics of entrepreneurship,"The economics of entrepreneurship explains how economic conditions and incentives affect entrepreneurship, and how the actions of entrepreneurs in turn affect the broader economy. For instance, the trade-off between expected financial returns and the risks of those returns affect the decisions of employees to become entrepreneurs. Also, this trade-off and economic incentives (financial inducements, for example, the prospect of a healthy profit) more generally affect the hiring and investment decisions that entrepreneurs make when they establish and grow their businesses. At the same time, these saving and investment decisions affect aggregate wealth accumulation in the economy, while entrepreneurs  hiring decisions affect an economy s aggregate employment and unemployment rates. The economics of entrepreneurship also analyses:   the effects of borrowing constraints on rates of entrepreneurial entry and performance;   the role played by entrepreneurs in stimulating employment and innovation growth in the economy;   the existence of market failures in entrepreneurial economies and the scope for public policy to design programmes to correct these failures;   how incentives within incumbent firms stimulate entrepreneurial spin-offs and the effects those have on the broader economy;   identification of the economic determinants of growth, at the levels of the venture, the region and the economy as a whole.

efficient market hypothesis EMH,"The classic definitions of the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH) were made by Harry Roberts (1967) and Eugene Fama (1970). Fama defined it in the following terms: ""An  efficient  market is defined as a market where there are large numbers of rational, profit  maximisers  actively competing, with each trying to predict future market values of individual securities, and where important current information is almost freely available to all participants. In an efficient market, competition among the many intelligent participants leads to a situation where, at any point in time, actual prices of individual securities already reflect the effects of information based both on events that have already occurred and on events which, as of now, the market expects to take place in the future. In other words, in an efficient market at any point in time the actual price of a security will be a good estimate of its intrinsic value"".   efficient markets hypothesis in the news In January 2012 an FT writer observed that regulators were having to rethink the concept of efficient markets.  The pre-crisis delusion was that the financial system, subject to the then defined rules, had an inherent tendency towards efficient and stable risk dispersion,  Adair Turner, chairman of the FSA was quoted as having said in 2011."
efficient portfolio,"The calculation for a portfolio of optimum returns for each level of risk, and minimum risk for each potential level of return. If expected returns are not met for a particular level of risk, or the risk required for a specific level of return turns out to be too high, the portfolio is said to be inefficient."

elastic demand,When a change in the price of something leads to a larger change in the amount of it that is sold or that could be sold if it was available. [1] 
elasticity,"The extent to which one variable responds to changes in another.  The (price) elasticity of demand and supply measures the responsiveness of demand and supply to price changes. If demand moves by more than the price change, it is described as relatively elastic; if it moves by less than the price change, it is relatively inelastic. Income elasticity of demand is the extent to which demand moves according to changes in income. Cross elasticity measures how demand for one product changes with respect to movements in the price of another. Elasticity of substitution is the extent to which one production input can be substituted for another."

elasticity of demand,"The degree to which the quantity of demand for an item is sensitive to change in the price of the item.  This can be calculated as: % change in quantity demanded divided by % change in price Example Typically, the quantity of demand will be lower at a higher price, so the price elasticity is negative, for instance, inferior goods such as low quality food and drinks. If the quantity of demand is sensitive to price, the demand is  elastic .  A drop in price would lead to an proportionately larger increase in the quantity of demand.  For example, the demand for non-essential services such as air travel and individual products with many alternatives such as a particular brand of tea are elastic. If the quantity of demand is insensitive to price, the demand is  inelastic , for instance:  essential goods and services such as food and heating items with few alternatives like petrol items that are addictive or habit-forming such as cigarettes  Vendors that face inelastic demand can raise prices and increase profit.

electoral college,"As called for in the US constitution, the electoral college serves to officially elect the president and vice president. It is made of 538 electors   a winner must have at least 270   who cast their vote in accordance with the results of the state they are there to represent. Each state has votes equal to the number of people it sends to Congress - one vote for each of two senators and further votes for each member of the House of Representatives. Representation in the House is weighted according to a state's population. The District of Columbia has three electors in the college. In nearly all states, whoever wins the popular vote gains all the electoral votes. ExampleAll but two states   Nebraska and Maine   allocate their electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis. Though the members of the electoral college were originally permitted to vote however they chose, they are now expected to vote for whoever won the majority or plurality of votes in their state.

elephants,"Elephants are large institutions (investment funds, investment banks and other major investors) that are able to make high volumes of trades in the stock markets. Due to their sheer size, their high trading volumes have the power to affect the price of these assets.

These institutions are so large they can cause individual share prices to rise or fall depending on the trading activity. [1]"
elevator pitch,"A term used in relation to entrepreneurship. An entrepreneur trying to raise money to pursue an idea often has very little time to draw interest from potential investors. We call these short conversations elevator pitches because the entrepreneur has about as much time as a typical elevator ride to close the deal. In practice, though, these pitches occur over coffee, at networking events and business plan competitions. The pitch should  - clearly state the problem you are trying to solve; - describe your solution in plain English; - demonstrate passion; - conclude with a specific 'ask' - like a follow-up meeting, introduction, or investment. Harvard Business School has an 'Elevator Pitch Builder', which advises entrepreneurs to use words such as leading, original, responsive and certified in their elevator pitches. Practice makes perfect. Also be sure to ask for feedback and refine your pitch as you go along, which keeps it fresh and interesting for you too. If you sound like you are giving the pitch for the 100th time, you are more likely to hear No for the 100th time. [1]"

emerging managers,"Emerging managers are investment managers that are newly created and have a small asset base. They are typically specialised and run by managers that believe they can attain higher returns by being focused and nimble. The criteria is evolving for defining exactly which managers should be considered emerging. ExampleSome consider funds with less than $500 million under management to be emerging, while others place that threshold at $2 billion. Others consider a definition of emerging managers to include a component relating to minority- or women-owned firms. [1]"
emerging markets,"Emerging market is a term that investors use to describe a developing country, in which investment would be expected to achieve higher returns but be accompanied by greater risk. Global index providers sometimes include in this category relatively wealthy countries whose economies are still considered underdeveloped from a regulatory point of view. [1] Emerging markets (EMs) sit between developed markets   for example, the US, the UK, core European countries and Japan   and 'frontier markets' which are even less developed than EMs. Smaller developed markets can also become 'emerging' - as is about to happen with Greece. Even index providers cannot agree on precisely what constitutes an emerging market. MSCI, the US company that introduced the benchmark MSCI Emerging Market index in 1988, defines an emerging market in terms of the number of quoted companies of a certain size and  free float  (the proportion of shares available for ordinary investors to buy), plus a market s openness to foreign ownership and capital.The MSCI index still includes South Korea, a relatively developed market, whereas FTSE s emerging markets index does not.The acronym  Brics  was coined in 2001 by Jim O Neill, then chief economist at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, to describe the four titans of Brazil, Russia, India and China. It s been followed by HSBC s  Civets    Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa   and the  Next 11    Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Korea, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Turkey and Vietnam. The case for investing in emerging markets seems beguilingly simple. They are growing and urbanising fast. They have young populations who aspire to consume as we in the west do. They generally have sound public finances, with no bloated welfare states or dependency cultures. So companies that are active in those markets should be able to increase profits and dividends rapidly, and their share prices should reflect that. But all too often, it does not work that way. [2]   emerging markets in the news Ever since Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, hinted in May 2013 that there may be an end in sight to the policy of aggressive monetary easing, emerging markets have been severely tested. Talk of tapering the Fed s purchase of $85bn a month in government bonds from September has pushed up long-term US interest rates. That in turn appears to have triggered a partial reversal of the carry trade in which investors borrow in dollars to purchase higher-yielding assets, often in emerging markets. Currencies and stock markets around the world, especially in countries with current account deficits financed by fickle capital inflows, have tumbled. [3] In September 2013, an FT post on Beyond Brics, asserted that reports of a lack of appetite for EM debt had been exaggerated. Experts said they expected more EM borrowers to come to the market to lock in cheap financing before the Fed tapering pushed rates higher.

empathic leadership,"Empathic leadership is the ability of leaders to understand, relate to and be sensitive to customers, colleagues and communities. Sociopathic leadership, on the other hand is arrogant, self-centred, insensitive and manipulative. The empathic leader will try to understand why their customers want to buy into their brand, not simply in a soft, touchy-feely way but literally from their point of view - from standing in their shoes. This brings a powerful and compelling aspect to the design, build and delivery of any product or service, the holy grail of business success and one reason why some brands are market leaders, but most are not.  Empathic leadership is not however, an easy path. For a start it goes against the myth of the hero leader. It s not about ego, it s about humility. It s not about fulfilling personal agendas, it s about helping customers, colleagues and communities to lead better lives. [1] See Column - Narcissists or psychopaths  Why bosses go bad           "

employer-financed retirement benefits scheme,"Employer-financed retirement benefits schemes (Efrbs) are discretionary trusts set up by an employer to provide benefits for an employee.  They have been promoted to earners in the top tax bands looking for ways to reduce their immediate tax deductions on earnings and bonuses. Tax on the benefits is only payable in the year of receipt of the benefit, providing an effective deferral of income tax.  [1] Example There are different types of tax avoidance schemes, such as K2 - the Jersey-based tax scheme. This is where an individual resigns from his/ her job in the UK and becomes an employee of an offshore company such as K2. [2] The individual receives a minimal salary from that company. K2 seconds (or hires out) the employee to his/ her original employer, and the original employer pays a fee to K2. The offshore company, via an employee benefits trust it sets up, lends this money to the individual. It has been described as an aggressive Efrb, but some experts say the arrangements are not the same. [3] So the individual take part of their income in the form of a loan and pays a lower amount of tax on the minimal income and not the loan. The British comedian Jimmy Carr's use of the scheme to reduce his taxes was exposed in June 2012.  He announced that he is no longer involved with the scheme.

endowment model,"Similar to the Yale Model, the endowment model allocates a significant portion of assets to non-traditional asset classes such as absolute return, private equity and real estate. Endowments typically believe that less liquid assets provide a good source of excess returns and that an unlimited time horizon allows them to bear the liquidity risk of such investments.

energy liberalisation,"Energy liberalisation is a political and regulatory process that brings competition into former electricity and gas monopolies. Competition occurs mainly in power generation and sales activities. Network activities such as transport and distribution are traditionally maintained regulated. The aim of energy liberalisation is to create competitive markets, leading to more efficiency and innovation in the industry. The argument of price reduction has been less valuable in the energy sector than in the telecommunications industry, mainly because of the rise of primary energy prices (fossil fuels and renewables). Energy liberalisation comes traditionally with a privatisation process, when formerly stated-owned utilities are privatised or part-privatised. Example In the European Union, energy liberalisation took place mainly between 1999 and 2007. The supervision of this process was conducted by competition authorities in Brussels (DG Competition & DG Energy) and locally in each member state. It has led to a complete reconfiguration of the electricity and gas industries. European actors like GDF-Suez, EDF, EON, RWE, Enel, and Iberdrola have built successful European positions. The gas-electricity convergence for pricing, marketing and generation has lead to a rapid growth of gas activities for former electrical actors. Access to natural gas resources is now a major political issue. [1] See  Article: Gazprom raided in EU antitrust investigation"

enterprise ethics,"Enterprise ethics refers to the notion that business and ethics are not separate - that business knowledge and ethical understanding are critical components of good decisions made at all levels of organisations. An enterprise ethics approach views individuals working in all areas of a company - for example , investor relations, marketing, operations or sales - as being responsible for ethics, and not just the people who have jobs related to ethics and compliance. Every worker can take actions that embody the purpose, vision, values and ethical ideals of an organisation and its stakeholders. Enterprise ethics are most often initiated by ethical leadership which connect the goals of the organisation with those of the internal employees and external stakeholders. ExampleToyota s reputation for quality was largely built upon the fact that all assembly line workers were empowered to pull the andon cord, which initiates the stoppage of the assembly line until an observed problem was resolved. Zappos, the online clothes, shoes and accessories store, built their reputation for customer service in a similar fashion. The people answering the phones are expected to stay on the line with customers until problems are resolved and they have significant leeway in how to do this. Enterprise ethics are about building and sustaining a culture where the company values are embodied by everyone in the company no matter where they sit in the organisational chart. [1]"
enterprise investment scheme,"Subject to detailed conditions, the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) gives income tax relief to individuals at 30 percent on qualifying investments in unquoted trading companies up to  1 million per annum, and exempts from capital gains tax (CGT) any gain on the disposal of qualifying shares on which income tax relief has been given (and not withdrawn). Where a loss arises on disposal, the investor can claim income tax relief for the amount of the loss (less any income tax relief given) against the income of the year of disposal or previous year, instead of being set off against capital gains. While investors have to be unconnected with the company two years before the issue of the shares and for three years afterwards, this does not prevent them becoming paid directors subsequently. Only those companies or groups with gross assets of less than  15 million before an investment and fewer than 250 employees can participate in the scheme. In addition, capital gains arising on other assets may be deferred against acquisitions of investments meeting the qualifying conditions under the EIS. The rules prohibiting connection with the company do not apply for this purpose. There is also an enhanced scheme aimed at increasing investment in the smallest companies. (See seed enterprise investment scheme SEIS.) [1]   enterprise investment scheme in the news The UK Budget Day 2015 announcement reveals that rules for tax-efficient venture capital schemes have been tightened, with criteria for qualifying companies to be updated to comply with EU state aid rules. Companies will only be able to raise  15m through the enterprise investment scheme or venture capital trusts, and will have to be less than 12 years old when receiving their first investments. Social investments, however, received a boost with the launch of social VCTs, which will attract the same tax advantages   namely tax-free dividends and capital gains tax-free gains on disposal   as VCTs. [2]"
enterprise management incentives,"A scheme designed with the aim of helping small companies attract and retain key employees by rewarding them with share options. To participate in the scheme companies must be either companies or holding companies of groups carrying on a qualifying trade and must have gross assets (for the company or the group as the case may be) no greater than  30 million, and fewer than 250 employees. Each eligible employee can hold options to acquire shares with an initial value of up to  250,000 and the total initial value of shares over which options are granted must not exceed  3 million. Provided various conditions are met, the grant and exercise of the options do not attract a tax charge. [1]"
enterprise value,"The sum of a company's market capitalisation and its net debt, useful for estimating the total cost (equity and assumed debt) of a takeover."
enterprise value  EV,"The sum of a company's market capitalisation and its net debt, useful for estimating the total cost (equity and assumed debt) of a takeover."
enterprise zones,Enterprise zones are designated areas that offer a range of benefits with the aim of attracting new businesses to an area or promoting investment from existing businesses. The range of incentives offered varies and may include: relief on local business rates; tax credits on investments in capital assets; relaxing or simplifying planning processes to make construction of premises cheaper and quicker; access to superfast broadband. Enterprise zones in assisted areas also qualify for enhanced capital allowances. These allowances are available between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2020. This will mean that first-year allowances of 100 percent will apply where a number of conditions are met to companies investing in plant and machinery for use within Enterprise Zones in designated areas. There are currently 24 Enterprise Zones in England with others in Scotland and Northern Ireland. [1]

entrepreneur,"In economic theory, an individual who purchases and organises the factors of production (land, labour and capital) to produce and sell goods in the expectation of making a profit. But generally speaking, an entrepreneur is an individual who pursues opportunities for financial or social gain, often at great financial risk. Entrepreneurs are often owners or co-owners of their own company or enterprise and are typically characterised by their initiative and conviction, regardless of resources available. Entrepreneurs create social and economic wealth through the creation of companies and jobs, as well as frequently innovating through the development of new products and services. [1]  characteristics of an entrepreneur Entrepreneurs tend to have good organisational skills, since new process-based ventures often revolve around simple, organisational improvements rather than the launch of a new product. Attitude is also key; whereas a future CEO sees role models in bosses, an entrepreneur is a fighter. Some have posited the idea that there is a link with entrepreneurship and dyslexia  - as demonstrated by the example of Richard Branson   which could put an individual at odds with educational authority.  Youth and enthusiasm are a plus, as entrepreneurs are usually in their late thirties, but not always   Ray Kroc established McDonalds at the age of 59.  Finally, social capital has been an important factor in the development of entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley to Bangalore; social networks can influence access to information and resources and be a source of advice."
entrepreneurial ecosystem,"The concept of an entrepreneurial ecosystem refers to the collective and systemic nature of entrepreneurship. New firms emerge and grow not only because heroic, talented and visionary individuals (entrepreneurs) created them and develop them. New ventures emerge also because they are located in an environment or ""ecosystem"" made of private and public players, which nurture and sustain them, making the action of entrepreneurs easier. For example, the existence of prior ventures, the availability of start-up financing mechanisms, a patent system and a culture tolerating failure all facilitate the creation of new firms. Conversely, the ecosystem can hinder entrepreneurship as is the case in corrupt societies or if an entrepreneur tries to introduce a radical innovation when no technical standard yet exists.According to D. Isenberg , an entrepreneurial ecosystem consists of elements that can be grouped into six domains: a conducive culture (e.g. tolerance of risk and mistakes, positive social status of entrepreneur); facilitating policies and leadership (e.g. regulatory framework incentives, existence of public research institutes); availability of dedicated finance (e.g. business angels, venture capital, micro loans); relevant human capital (e.g. skilled and unskilled labour, serial entrepreneurs, entrepreneurship training programmes); venture-friendly markets for products (e.g. early adopters for prototypes, reference customers), and a wide set of institutional and infrastructural supports (e.g. legal and accounting advisers, telecommunications and transportation infrastructure, entrepreneurship promoting associations). Based on this definition, governments can evaluate whether they have a strong entrepreneurial ecosystem and what actions they should put in place, knowing that each entrepreneurial ecosystem is unique and all elements of the ecosystem are interdependent. Therefore, generic reasons for explaining or creating a functioning entrepreneurial ecosystem or importing a single element from such an ecosystem are of little practical value. Successful dynamics often result from the identification of local assets, which may be in very limited numbers (like the firms Shockley, Fairchild, and HP who helped create the Silicon Valley, or Digital Equipment Corporation who contributed to Boston s cluster). Focusing on innovative ventures specifically, other scholars have developed measurement scales that allow for international comparisons. For example, Jonathan Levie and his colleagues have identified some weaknesses of the Scottish entrepreneurial ecosystem, which can be transformed into priority issues, namely:  a need for more financing for growth (venture capital), increased effective networking, skills for growth (especially sales skills), a more significant contribution from universities, a growing number of role models and positive messages.  Entrepreneurial ecosystems in real life The absolute model of a successful entrepreneurial ecosystem is the well-known Silicon Valley with its numerous and often leading high-tech companies and a very well-developed venture capital base. Many countries and regions have tried to emulate it, though often with limited success. Israel, Ireland and Taiwan also represent very dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystems. Such ecosystems have been developed for specific sectors: Germany did so in the life sciences domain with ""BioRegio"", launched by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research in 1995, which sustained vivid entrepreneurial dynamics in biotechnology and made this programme famous Europe-wide. Developing dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystems is currently one of the objectives pursued by the European Commission which, in its ""Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan"", talks of ""creating an environment where entrepreneurs can flourish and grow"" through better access to finance, better support for new businesses in crucial phases of their lifecycle, easier business transfers, or clearer and simpler regulations.[1]"
entrepreneurial mindset,"Entrepreneurial mindset refers to a specific state of mind which orientates human conduct towards entrepreneurial activities and outcomes. Individuals with entrepreneurial mindsets are often drawn to opportunities, innovation and new value creation. Characteristics include the ability to take calculated risks and accept the realities of change and uncertainty. [1]"
entrepreneurial opportunity,"Entrepreneurial opportunity emerges at the nexus of individual aspirations with economic and social conditions perceived as favourable to create a new product or service, either in an existing market or a new one. [1]"
entrepreneurial orientation,"Entrepreneurial orientation is usually defined as a multidimensional construct, applied at the organisational level, which characterises firm s entrepreneurial behaviour and includes one or several of these three dimensions: risk-taking, innovativeness and pro-activeness. [1]"
entrepreneurship,"Entrepreneurship is the key driver of a dynamic company and involves the recognition and evaluation of opportunities, where that means increasing the value of a existing product or service or creating mass markets with new technology. It is triggered by four main factors, first of all, discontinuity: social and technological shifts (for example, the growth of broadband, or the growth of ageing populations) create challenges for policy makers but opportunities for entrepreneurs. Secondly, regulation can force new innovation, as environmental regulations created mobile phone opportunities with the opening of wireless spectrums. Technology is also an important trigger; the application of existing technology can lead to the development of a new industry and the solving of a problem in a way that is exploitable in terms of intellectual property. Finally, serendipity, or accidental discovery can encourage entrepreneurship, though it's comparatively rare when compared with the gains made by small changes to supply channels. Entrepreneurship involves creating or discovering new ideas or opportunities for the purpose of creating value, whether economic, social, or even political   and forming a new organisation to do so. An entrepreneur is a person who practises entrepreneurship.  examples of entrepreneurship According to this definition, the late Steve Jobs was an entrepreneur when he founded Apple, but no longer practiced entrepreneurship once he launched new innovations as a corporate manager. The founders of social networking websites Twitter and Facebook are practising entrepreneurship.Somebody who starts up a  copycat  company may be an entrepreneur in a limited sense, by creating value for him/herself and his/her family and intensifying price competition to the benefit of consumers. But as an act of entrepreneurship, it involves little novelty and little value creation, so is less  entrepreneurial  than, say, the launch of a new biotech company which commercialises a brand new life-saving product. [1]"
entrepreneurs relief,"Entrepreneurs  relief, broadly, allows individuals and trustees with qualifying gains on the disposal of  business assets  to benefit from a reduced rate of capital gains tax (CGT) up to a lifetime limit of  10 million, providing specific conditions are met. [1]"

environmental sustainability,"A state in which the demands placed on the environment can be met without reducing its capacity to allow all people to live well, now and in the future. Evidence is strong that we are exceeding and eroding the earth's carrying capacity, that there are limits to growth on a finite planet.  Effects are interactive, complex, unpredictable and escalating, as we head for a global average temperature rise of more than 2 degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels. Sometimes 'environmental', 'social' and 'economic' are termed to be the three pillars of sustainability.  But this is problematic as it suggests they are equivalent and can be traded.  Environmental sustainability is the context within which social and economic life happen. Also, social inequity directly affects environmental viability. Leading thinkers suggest that to stand any chance of achieving environmental sustainability, businesses need to move from a sense of right-to-exploit the natural environment to a worldview of mutual interdependence and radical eco-innovation.  Many organisations are now taking on this challenge.[1] Examples  Some routes towards environmental sustainability include: adopt so called 'cradle-to-cradle thinking and practices'; dramatically reduce CO2 emissions; stop rainforest destruction; combine contraction (in carbon use for affluent parts of the world) and convergence to align carbon footprints internationally, within safe planetary operating limits.

equity,"What a shareholder owns in a corporation, entitling him/her to part of that entity's profits (in the form of dividends) and a measure of control (through shareholder voting rights). The total capital in a company owned by shareholders is called shareholder's equity or equity capital (in essence, assets minus liabilities such as debt and other obligations to non-shareholders). If liabilities exceed assets on the balance sheet, then a company is said to have negative equity. The markets where equity (stocks/shares are also called equities) is traded are called the equity markets (the same as stock markets).  Equity is also the market value of a property after deducting unpaid mortgage. In this case, negative equity occurs when the property is worth less than the debt on it. "

Also called the equity method (of accounting).
equity bridge or bridge equity,This is short-term financing to allow private equity firms or other buyers of corporate assets to complete deals before longer-term financing is secured.  [1]
equity capital,See capital
equity carve-out,"In an equity carve-out, a company lists a part or division of their business on the stock market in an initial public offering (IPO). This technique is part of the spectrum of techniques employed in mergers & acquisitions. In most cases, companies keep majority control (more than 50 per cent) over that business division althouth they may opt to reduce the stake later. The company might also opt to distribute shares in the new entity to its existing shareholders instead of selling them on the stock market to new investors. The reason why companies use equity carve-outs is to increase the value of their business. In many cases, the division might offer low synergies with the actual core business. This can mean that investors rate that business as part of the larger group at a lower valuation than it might otherwise achieve as it is subject to a conglomerate discount. If the conglomerate owner can get this entity listed separately, the business can act more independently and focus on growing the business with fewer constraints. It should then achieve a higher valuation and might be perceived as a takeover target as well. This technique is frequently used by governments in privatisations. Especially in large privatisations where there are no obvious acquirers. In this case the equity carve out is perceived as the ""via regia"", a route to a more ideal status quo. These privatisations dominate the ranking of the largest equity carve-outs by transaction value by far. The top 3 include EnteNazionale per l Energia by the Italian government at  17.8bn in 1999, NTT by the Japanese government at Y1.5tn in 1999 and Deutsche Telekom by the German government at DM20.3bn in 1992. Among the biggest equity carve-outs by non-government owned companies are a 50 per cent stake in Agfa-Gevaert NV by Bayer AG valued at  1.5bn in 1998 or the sale of 35 per cent stake in Snam Rete Gas SpA by ENI SpA valued at  1.9bn in 2001.   Equity carve-outs in the news More recent examples of discussions of equity carve-outs include the news in June 2012 of Pfizer s decision to spin off its animal health business. Companies, however, should first have a thorough review and get their strategy right before using equity carve-outs. For example, Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche acquired Genentech then later listed part of it in an equity carve-out only to buy these shares again in a tender offer after a couple of years.[1]"

equity market segmentation,"A term from international finance and economics that describes how a country s capital market can be separate from the capital markets of other countries. A related term is  barriers to capital flow .  The concept has implications for whether investors in different countries estimate a different cost of capital and, in particular, disagree about the value of a particular investment. As a starting point, suppose that the price of stock XYZ is $50 in Boston and $45 in New York.  Unless there is a legal barrier or very substantial cost to buying and selling stocks, smart traders will buy XYZ in New York and simultaneously sell it in Boston.  Eventually, the pressure of buying in New York will raise the price there, the pressure of selling in Boston will lower the price there, and the value of XYZ across the two cities will converge. Extending the example internationally, in the absence of barriers or substantial trading costs, XYZ will sell for about the same price in Boston and in Halifax.  However, we can introduce some impediments to the arbitrage process that tends to force XYZ prices to be equal between the US and Canada. Perhaps there are very high brokerage costs and other fees for trading in one market or another.  In that case, a gap in prices can persist. Perhaps a tax is applied when an investor buys the stock in one country and sells in another. Perhaps XYZ is a Canadian company and it cannot even be traded in Boston or New York due to national law or provisions in the company s charter that forbid Americans or other non Canadians to own the stock. If limitations to foreign investment apply not just to XYZ but many Canadian companies, we will observe a divergence between stock prices, returns, dividend yields, and other market conditions in Canada compared to the rest of the world.  This separation is known as equity market segmentation.  As a practical matter, it is more likely to be observed for a developing country where legal barriers, political and legal risks, high currency uncertainty, trading costs, and other factors are magnified, rather than for Canada or the US. The stereotype is that a developing country lacks savings for development and segmentation of its equity market drives away inexpensive capital from overseas that might help the economy to grow. Segmentation may also deprive local citizens of the ability to diversify their wealth if laws and other facets of the capital market impede or prohibit their investing some of their savings overseas. Thus, market segmentation may be viewed as damaging the potential growth and health of an economy. There is a counter-argument to the notion that equity market segmentation is always damaging.  If foreign investors tend to rush in and out of the stock markets of small developing countries, they may increase volatility and uncertainty.  Their  hot money  greatly boosts stock prices when it arrives, then causes a crash when it leaves. Thus, one can argue that keeping a country s stock market somewhat segmented from such forces protects the country s economy from being buffeted by short term inflows and outflows. Because most countries are either largely or somewhat open to foreign equity market purchases and sales, it is typically hard to measure whether a country s stock market is  completely segmented ,  partially segmented , or  integrated .  Researchers continue to struggle with this question. [1]"

ethical decision making,"Ethical decision making helps people make difficult choices when faced with an ethical dilemma, a situation in which there is no clear right or wrong answer. For example, would it be right for a CEO to keep a contractual bonus when the business is making lower-paid colleagues redundant  Ethical decision making typically examines three perspectives: the ethic of obedience; the ethic of care; and the ethic of reason. The ethic of obedience looks not only at the letter of the law, but also the spirit or moral values behind it. The ethic of care engages our emotional intelligence and empathy in making a decision from other people s perspectives: ""How would I feel in their shoes "". Finally, the ethic of reason engages our rational brain. Here we might use wisdom and experience to calculate various likely outcomes. This three dimensional approach engages both intellect and emotional intelligence and requires what Daniel Kahneman (Kahneman, D. (2011). Thinking Fast and Slow, Allen Lane 2011) calls ""slow thinking"". The other vital ingredient for ethical decision making is the social dimension. When faced with difficult choices, human beings tend to make better decisions when they work these through with others who can both support the three-dimensional process and challenge our natural biases and prejudices. [1]   ethical decison making in the news   In July 2013 the author of this definition, Roger Steare, corporate philosopher in residence at Cass Business School, wrote to the FT pointing out that European Banking Authority data showed bankers had been paid more than  1m across the EU in 2011, but that the research did not demonstrate whether they had actually ""earned"" this reward.

ExampleGreen and Blacks, a UK-based chocolate company, submitted its Maya Gold Chocolate line to the Fair Trade certification process for its partnership with the Toledo Cacao Growers Association of Belize.

ethnographic market research,"This is a systematic market research observing customers in their own environment using products and services.  This is useful for exploring how existing products and services are used and for spotting opportunities for breakthrough innovations. The key characteristics of ethnographic market research are:  In-depth visits to customers  locations; Collection of multiple types of qualitative data: including videos of product usage, and answers to contextual interviews.  These are interviews conducted in the customer s environment and asking some prepared questions and some spontaneous ones; Systematic analysis  based on coding (identification of the key issues in qualitative data), looking for contradictions (for example. where a customer says one thing and does another), and identifying the cultural characteristics of the customer segment being investigated.  Example Through visiting customers in their homes, companies can gain powerful insights into real product requirements. For instance, Panasonic used ethnographic market research to probe requirements for an electric shaver for women.  By recording the grooming behaviour of women in their research, the company was able to develop an ergonomic design with the right colours and style to fit the US market. This product, named the Lady Shaver, needed to be significantly different to shavers developed for the Japanese market. The in-depth market knowledge generated by ethnographic techniques made it possible to identify the product features that were specific to the US market. The Japanese market required high gloss white, as this is associated, in that culture, with quality. US women perceived gloss/white as slippery (especially for a product that is sometimes used in the shower) and preferred pastel colours with a rubberised (non slip) finish. Use of rubber surfaces on the product for the US also underlined the waterproof nature of the shaver in the customer s mind. Ethnographic market research can also be applied to B2B products and services. [1]  "

exchange traded funds  ETFs,"Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are index-tracking funds that can be traded on exchanges just like a stock   so they combine the diversified holdings of a fund with the low cost and tradability of a share.                 ETFs work rather like index-tracker unit trusts or open-ended investment companies (Oeics), holding a portfolio of shares, commodities or other securities to replicate the performance or an index, sector or asset class. However, they generally have lower management charges, and can be bought and sold at any time through a stockbroker, rather like closed-ended investment trusts. Also, like investment trusts, their prices change continuously throughout the trading day, reflecting the value of the assets they track and sentiment in the market. ETFs track an index in two broad manners. A physical ETF holds the same percentage of the underlying stocks of the index as is represented by their percentage of the index. So, for example, if a stock represents 2 per cent of an index, then 2 per cent of the value of the ETF holdings will be in that stock. A synthetic ETF uses derivatives to achieve the same returns as the index it tracks.   Well-known providers of ETFs include iShares, Vanguard and State Street. ETFs have grown in popularity because of their low fees, tradability (that is liquid and traded on exchanges), tax efficiency and diversification benefits.

expansionary monetary policy,"A policy by monetary authorities to expand money supply and boost economic activity, mainly by keeping interest rates low to encourage borrowing by companies, individuals and banks. An expansionary monetary policy can involve quantitative easing, whereby central banks purchase assets from banks. This has the effect of lowering yields on bonds and creating cheaper borrowing for banks. This, in turn, boosts banks' capacity to lend to individuals and businesses. An expansionary monetary policy also risks ramping up inflation.   expansionary monetary policy in the news In June 2013, Martin Wolf, an FT columnist, commented that as yields on bonds of highly rated sovereign had risen it was a sign of success. He wrote this could mean that investors could expect an earlier exit from quantitative easing and other forms of expansionary monetary policy than had been foreseen. In July 2013, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Adam Posen, wrote that despite unjustified claims, quantitative easing and other forms of expansionary monetary policy, as pursued by Japan, did not constitute currency manipulation. Instead the policy had been pursued with purely domestic aims. In September 2013, an FT Alphaville blog alluded to an argument over the true causes of the great inflation period of the 1970s. It was suggested that instead of the inflation being a result of expansionary monetary policies, it was due to population demographics: namely baby boomers and females entering in the work force."
expatriate,"An employee who is sent to live abroad for a defined time period. An expatriate is expected to relocate abroad, with or without family, for as short a period as six months to a year; typical expat assignments, however, are from two to five years long. Organisations use expatriate assignments as a means to send key staff abroad for high-potential career development and to co-ordinate global lines of business, as well as transfer organisational knowledge, expand into new markets worldwide, and/or manage an international subsidiary. However, expatriate assignments can be costly endeavors for organizations due to special compensation packages, housing and relocation costs, pre-departure training, and so forth. Research has consistently shown that cross-cultural and family adjustment are factors that contribute to the effectiveness of the expatriate s presence abroad. For individuals, expatriate assignments represent opportunities and challenges both professionally and personally. The assignments provide the novelty and excitement of moving to another country and operating in a different cultural environment. They can also provide an opportunity to acquire new language skills, develop cultural understanding, and see new parts of the world. However, adjusting to a new country can prove challenging for expatriates and their families. Example Family considerations are often cited as a driving reason for employees to decline an expatriate assignment, or for the failure of an expatriate to complete the assignment abroad. However, employees may also be unsure how expatriate assignments fit into their overall career development and relate to intra-organisational career success. Fearing their organisational commitment might be put into question, an employee may find that family not wanting to relocate or stay abroad is perhaps a more convenient (and therefore more frequently cited) reason. In order to overcome hurdles of expatriate adjustment, organisations should encourage open and ongoing communication between managers, HR and potential candidates when assignments are first arranged, and then continue follow-up when the expatriate is on assignment.

explicit collusion,"Explicit collusion is an agreement among competitors to suppress rivalry that relies on interfirm communication and/or transfers.  Rivalry between competitors erodes profits; the suppression of rivalry through collusion is one avenue by which firms can enhance profits. Explicit collusion is distinct from tacit collusion, which is not illigal.  Economists label equilibria in which firms recognise their ongoing interdependence, but that do not require direct interaction between firms, such as communication or transfers, as tacit rather than explicit collusion. When purchases are sufficiently large and infrequent, or demand is sufficiently uncertain, or buyers are strategic, it may not be possible for firms to elevate prices with only tacit collusion, even if the firms are engaged in repeated interaction over time. Example The primary manufacturers of vitamins, including Hoffmann-La Roche, BASF, Rhone-Poulenc, Merck KgaA, and others, admitted to explicit collusion, which they organised as an international market-sharing agreement, for several years during the 1990s.  Evidence suggests that even after the end of explicit collusion, for vitamin products manufactured by only two of the former conspirators, firms were able to maintain high prices through tacit collusion.

externalities,"Positive externalities can be defined as cost savings to a company that result from the concentration of firms and industries at a given location. The net benefit to being in a location together with other firms, is argued to increase with the number of firms and industries at the location, creating external economies. (Positive externalities can also result from the external provision of a benefit, such as a road, to a company that previously had poor infrastructure connnections. It is also possible to have negative externalities, such as pollution from economic activity, see externality.) A localised industry of competing firms creates an external economy of scale, or localisation externality. The large number of competing firms at a location attracts workers and suppliers, and can increase a firm s returns, according to the economist and newspaper columnist Paul Krugman. Labour market pooling benefits both workers and companies since a large labour pool helps the individual firm cope with the uncertainty related to the firm business cycle. Urbanisation externality arises from the diversity of industries in a city or region. Thriving industries at a location draws a more diverse labour pool and brings about better infrastructure and all other benefits associated with the formation of cities. For example, a competitive machinery maintenance industry, which provides specialist support to the food processing industry at a location, may also attract another a new industry   a paper processing industry- which seeks to benefit the form of urbanisation externality. This is an external economy of scope brought about by diversity of industries in urban concentration typically. A pecuniary externality is said to exist if the profits of a firm depend not only on its own activity but also on the activities of other firms in upstream and lateral industries at the location. This is a complex external economy due to economic transactions taking place between such firms in upstream and lateral sectors. For example, the nature of insurance and reinsurance processes involves a chain of insurance firms and private equity holders in London's financial centre to spread the risk acquired of a profitable venture, and therefore bring net pecuniary benefits to all involved. A positive pecuniary externality arises in such clusters when the economic benefits outweigh the cost of clustering, such as the increased congestion and transportation costs.[1]"
externality,"A specific and often unexpected effect on one party arising from an activity by another, and thus not fully reflected in market prices. For example, the impact on a manufacturing plant of the waste being dumped by another separately owned plant close by. This would be known as a negative externality."

However, he and some of his colleagues in R&D; raised some concerns about a new drug. Indeed, some scientific articles asserted that a molecule in this particular drug could create strong side effects, while other scientists considered that this new remedy could save many lives.Before even submitting this medicine to the regulatory authorities, Rik wanted to collect a more informed opinion of the risks of this drug. He wanted to convene a meeting and decided to call a professional facilitator, whose role was to prepare and run the meeting with several world experts in the field. During an entire day, the facilitator kept the dialogue focused and made sure that all the experts were heard.  Firstly, they had to determine if there was a potential risk associated with this medicine.  Secondly, if there was a risk, then what is its level and what kind of animal studies or lab experiments would be required to evaluate the risk. At the end of the meeting, the facilitator summarised the key findings and a possible action plan that all experts approved of. After carefully weighing the results of this facilitation, Rik was able to advise his vice-president of R&D; to decide the next steps to take. [1]"

fair value,"The value of a product or service based on the price at which it could be sold in a transparent and free market with both seller and buyer happy to trade and armed with all relevant information. Applied to stock valuations, fair value is the price that a securities analyst or investor places on a stock based on a commonly accepted valuation system, such as net asset value per share. In futures trade, it is the spot price of the underlying asset plus the cost of carry. Also called fair price. Fair value is used to distinguish between the amount that someone pays for an asset, which should be referred to as its historical cost. Historical cost, unlike fair value, may not be a good indication of what an asset is worth today.   fair value in the news In February 2014 an economist blogging for the Financial Times noted that US equities were trading about 70 per cent above fair value. He derived his calculation of fair value by using both  CAPE and Tobin's q, two different valuation systems."
fair value accounting,"An alternative approach to measurement that seeks to capture changes in asset and liability values over time. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) defines fair value as ""... an amount at which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arms length transaction"". Under the fair value measurement approach, assets and liabilities are re-measured periodically to reflect changes in their value, with the resulting change impacting either net income or other comprehensive income for the period. The result is a balance sheet that better reflects the current value of assets and liabilities. The cost is greater volatility in periodic reported performance caused by changes in fair value.  The notion of fair value accounting is intuitive when applied to quoted investments such as equities, bonds, commodities, etc. that are carried in an entity s balance sheet at their market value. This form of fair value accounting is often termed mark-to-market accounting. However, while market prices are one aspect of fair value measurement, the term is increasingly being used to describe measurement by other means. For example, accountants often arrive at an estimate of fair value for non-quoted investments based on a model (e.g., a share option valued by applying a specialist option valuation model) or specialist opinion. Such applications of fair value measurement are referred to as mark-to-model accounting. The IASB has followed US standard-setters in dealing with the problem of fair values that do not result from market prices. Specifically, IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement applies the following valuation hierarchy: Level 1: fair values are derived from quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities from an active market for which an entity has immediate access Level 2: where there are market prices available for similar (as opposed to identical) assets or liabilities Level 3: if values for levels 1 or 2 are not available, fair value is estimated using valuation techniques Fair value accounting is most frequently applied to financial assets and liabilities because market prices or reliable estimates thereof are most likely to exist for such elements. Proponents argue that fair value accounting for assets or liabilities better reflects current market conditions and hence provides timely information. Opponents, on the other hand, argue that fair values can be irrelevant and potentially misleading for a variety of reasons. For example, some claim that fair value is not relevant for items that are held for a long period (i.e., to maturity) as investors are not interested in interim value changes. Others argue that fair values can be distorted by market inefficiencies, investor irrationality or liquidity problems and that estimated values derived from models may lack reliability. Finally, fair value accounting has been criticised for contributing to procyclicality in the financial system by exacerbating market swings and causing a downward spiral in financial markets. In particular, some commentators argue that emphasis on level 1 and 2 valuations makes it difficult to deviate from market prices, even if prices are below fundamentals or they give rise to contagion effects.

family business,"According to the Family Business Expert Group, an enterprise of any size is a family business, if:  1) The majority of decision-making rights is in the possession of the natural person(s) who established the firm, or in the possession of the natural person(s) who has/have acquired the share capital of the firm, or in the possession of their spouses, parents, child or children s direct heirs; 2) The majority of decision-making rights are indirect or direct; 3) At least one representative of the family or kin is formally involved in the governance of the firm; 4) Listed companies meet the definition of family enterprise if the person who established or acquired the firm (share capital) or their families or descendants possess 25 per cent of the decision-making rights mandated by their share capital.  A family business is a hybrid organisational form, whose identity encompasses the overlap of a family system and a business system. Due to the integration of these two systems, one based on economic principles and the other based on emotions, family businesses are characterised as emotional arenas, with strong intergenerational issues such as managing successful transitions. As very few family businesses survive beyond the second generation, and this form of enterprise is spreading out across the world, they prevent intergenerational conflicts through writing formal agreements or  constitutions  which are both a shareholders' agreement and a code of conduct.    family businesses in the news Because of their heritage, their long-term view and their commitment to the community, family enterprises are increasingly emphasised as symbols pf stability and accountability. Additionally, local family enterprises are more and more perceived as manufacturers of quality products and services. Nowadays, in countries such as France and the UK, UK-based and France-based production appears to the customers as a guarantee of reliability and excellence. In Saudi Arabia, family businesses dominate the country s economy and some of them have become regional giants. Around the world, countries such as Poland are, however, confronted with both positive and negative consequences of family businesses  wealth and status.[1] "

fast fashion,"Fast fashion companies copy catwalk looks and tend to use extremely efficient supply chains to release more of these collections each year than other retailers.  Items are sold cheaply and released quickly into stores. Consumers, who are generally young, can purchase fast fashion clothes from retailers such as H&M;, Inditex s Zara and Forever 21. [1]   fast fashion in the news In 2015, an FT writer pointed out young shoppers are drawn to the rapid turnover at fast fashion shops.  The appeal of fast fashion is not higher quality. Instead, consumers are drawn to stores by a chance to buy fashionable, cheap clothes that may not last long, either on the display or in wardrobes. Shoppers have come to regard clothes as disposable   if a shirt comes apart, they buy a new one. This approach was conceived by Americans in the 1990s. The idea was that  quick response  could help the US textile industry work more effectively with retailers and stem the tide of production moving offshore. In practice, it did little for the US industry but a great deal for Europe s. Inditex, the global Spanish clothing company, adopted it as the foundation of fast fashion. The Inditex approach has a lot in common with the Toyota method of carmaking. Instead of widely dispersed and fragmented networks of suppliers, the group has many suppliers clustered around its headquarters in A Coru a, Spain, where designers and supply chain executives work closely together. That enables Zara, the clothing high street chain owned by Inditex, to move from design to display in weeks. [2]"

fast-expanding market,"The expression  fast-expanding market  refers to any rapidly growing opportunity. The market is the focal point, and it may exist at supranational, national, regional, industry, cluster, firm or even product level.   why we should use the term fast-expanding market Fast-expanding market as a term serves as a more encompassing yet precise alternative to  emerging market ,  developing country  and  frontier market . These latter terms are commonly used to imply the sources of growth; however, this application is at best incomplete and at worst plain wrong. Firstly, their level of analysis is restricted to macroeconomic and/or regional, national or supranational. Arguably, new opportunities more often than not exist at more granular levels. Japan as an economic power may be dwindling, but growing industries, for example, cultural goods, still exist there. Secondly, the distinction between the  emerging  and  advanced  markets is becoming increasingly blurred   just compare the economic evolution of an emerging market such as Singapore to the so-called  developed  countries of Greece and Spain. There is another significant point to note regarding the term  fast-expanding market ; as important as the search for fresh sources of growth should be, it is surprising but true that we do not currently have in our dictionary a proper term dedicated to describing new growth opportunities.  Fast-expanding market  steps in nicely to do the job.[1] BeyondBrics: the FT's emerging markets hub"

fat finger error,"A fat finger error is a widely used term in the finance industry and describes a typographical error supposedly caused by hitting the wrong key, or by making mistakes when inputting a quantity into a computer (for example, adding a zero to the end of a figure).   fat finger error in the news Since the advent of trading on computers, errors involving so-called ""fat fingers"" have rarely been far away. Among the most notable examples came in 2006 when an error by a trader at Mizuho Securities in Japan left the broker with a large short position that it had to unwind at a cost of more than Y40bn. More recently a sudden 15 per cent drop in the value of Mumbai stock exchange was caused by a fat finger. However the emergence of high-frequency trading, in which buy and sell signals for assets are often taken automatically from trades made by computers, has blurred the lines between human, ""fat finger"" errors and computer-driven trades. Increasingly, exchanges and brokers have been developing operational and technological safeguards such as ""kill switches"" to limit damage from errant trading. In January 2013 some sources were blaming ""fat finger errors"" for some hard to fathom  Euribor quotes from banks."
fat tails,"A fat-tailed distribution is one of the so-called heavy-tailed statistical distributions that describe the probability of certain events. Fat tails have a sharp bell shape which leads to the term leptokurtosis, another name for a fat tailed distribution. A probability distribution with fat tails would be one in which moderately extreme outcomes were more likely than you might have expected. Strictly speaking this differs from a long tailed distribution in would be one in which very very extreme outcomes have non negligible probabilities. Fat-tail and long-tail probability analysis is used in financial risk management, but it would seem that statisticians and investment professionals would sometimes disagree on what constitues a fat tail and what is a long tail. See the two diagrams below.    The diagram to the left is the one usually referred to by statisticians but the distance of the ends of the long tails above the base line leads to some confusion. See the diagram provided by Pimco to explain tail risk to investors below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      fat tails in the news In April 2012, Martin Wolf, chief economic commentator at the FT, considered the arguments of Paul McCulley, former managing director of Pimco and Zoltan Pozsar, formerly at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In a paper they co-authored they put the case for aggressive fiscal policy. They argued that fiscal austerity does not work in a liquidity trap and makes as much sense ""as putting an anorexic on a diet"".  They argue that ""in a liquidity trap, the fat-tail risk of inflation is replaced by the fat-tail risk of deflation""."

feedback loop,"A feedback loop is a term commonly used in economics to refer to a situation where part of the output of a situation is used for new input. An example of a positive feedback loop would be one where success feeds success. A company could make money which is then reinvested in activities which lead to more income generation. Likewise a population with rising income per capita, spends more money which in turns leads to rising income per capita.  A negative feedback loop is strictly speaking one that brings about a situation which is self regulating. For example, a population of lions grows and eats much of its available prey. There is then a shortage of food for the lions which causes a reduction in the lions' population and allows a resurgence in the populations of the animals they hunt.   examples of feedback loop in the news An economist interviewed by the FT on the US housing market in January 2013 was talking about the beginning of a reversal of the house price crash in hard-hit areas such as Florida. If house buyers regained enough equity they would be able to jump from interest rates that they locked into before the house price crash of 6-7 per cent and be able to refinance at current levels of 3.5 per cent. Households that manage to refinance will be able to consume more. ""There's going to be a positive feedback loop that will help refinancing, help home sales and have a wealth effect,"" the economist said. Also in January 2013 there were signs that a severe drought would persist in certain areas of the United States. A forecaster at a climate research institute commented that drought tends to intensify because moisture tends to evapourate more quickly than it would do from saturated ground. ""There's a positive feedback loop, unfortunately, for drought,"" the forecaster commented."

feral hogs,"The term feral hogs became renowned for its use in a financial context when a top US central banker, interviewed by the FT in June 2013, talked about the behaviour of big money in markets. Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve and a former hedge fund manager, said the ""feral hogs"" of financial markets were trying to force the US Federal Reserve to back down on its plans to taper its bond buying programme.  Markets tend to test things,  Mr Fisher told the FT.  We haven t forgotten what happened to the Bank of England [on Black Wednesday]. I don t think anyone can break the Fed . . . But I do believe that big money does organise itself somewhat like feral hogs. If they detect a weakness or a bad scent, they ll go after it.    feral hogs in the news The comment about feral hogs, published on June 24 2013, had the effect of slightly reining in rising rates, according to a CNBC report published later the same day. ""Mr Fisher used 'feral hogs' as a reference. We all know bulls and bears make money and hogs get slaughtered,"" said one commentator interviewed by the news organisation."
ff,Written abbreviation for following pages. [1] 
fiat money,"Paper money or coins of little or no intrinsic value in themselves and not convertible into gold or silver, but made legal tender by fiat (order) of the government. [1] Fiat money is an intrinsically worthless object, such as paper money, that is deemed to be money by law. To place it into historical context, one could think of three phases concerning the development of money. First, money itself was a valuable object, such as gold, fur or peppercorns. Second, paper money circulated, but this money was backed up by holdings of gold, and indeed could be converted into gold at a fixed price at any time. Third, paper money circulated, but it was not backed up by anything other than the government s promise that it will refrain from printing too much money so as to make it worthless. Since Bretton Woods, almost all paper money is of this type.  ExampleThe problem, of course, was that sometimes governments broke their promise. Following World War I, Germany printed so much money that what could be purchased for one mark in 1918 cost about one trillion marks in 1923. For instance, in 2009, one US dollar brought you more than 6 billion Zimbabwe dollars at the official exchange rate (and this was even after multiple currency reforms due to prior excessive inflation rates). In both cases the government lost credibility so that it could not borrow to finance large budget deficits, and hence had to pay its bills with massive amounts of newly-printed fiat money.

financial repression,"Financial repression is a term used to describe measures sometimes used by governments to boost their coffers and/or reduce debt. These measures include the deliberate attempt to hold down interest rates to below inflation, representing a tax on savers and a transfer of benefits from lenders to borrowers. Financial repression is also used to describe measures to facilitate a domestic market for government debt and the imposition of capital controls. The combined effect of all these measures means funds are channeled to the government that would otherwise flow elsewhere. Financial repression in China is said to be the cause of its huge accumulation of foreign currency reserves. Similarly western governments were being accused of financial repression following the 2008/2009 financial crisis as they embarked on measures including quantitative easing, capping interest rates and creating more domestic demand for their own bonds.   financial repression in the news In 2012 and 2013 pension funds and insurers, in particular, were suffering the results of financial repression after being forced by new regulations to increase their holdings of safe assets, such as government bonds, to improve the quality of their capital buffers. By the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013, market commentators were beginning to talk of ""financial coercion"" and argued that governments were pushing investors into risk assets to maintain real returns."

Eurozone states and central banks intervening in sovereign bond markets would not be liable although ordinary traders in the same markets would.   financial transaction tax (FTT) in the news In January 2013, it was proposed that Germany, France and nine other euro area countries would agree the exact terms of Europe's financial transaction tax. The draft was published that cast a wider net than expected and added anti-avoidance measures so that financial business would not decamp to safer havens. It was proposed that the tax should apply to financial products issued in the participating area of Europe, even if the parties were trading it only in Asia, the US or Britain (which opposes the tax). Critics of the proposals said the tax would affect long term growth and cost jobs. In depth page on financial transaction tax"

firm entry rate,"In a certain industry, the firm entry rate in a given period of time is the number of firms that began operations during that period, divided by the total number of firms that operated during the preceding period. In part, entry rates reflect the impact of government regulations that assign competitive advantages to existing firms or make it harder for prospective entrepreneurs to start operating. Entry rates measure churning in an industry, meaning the pace at which the identity of producers change over time. The significance of this pace cannot be evaluated in general as it depends on a variety of factors. ExampleEconomists regard financing constraints as one of the most biggest obstacles to entry. Given the absence of unsecured credit, starting a new business on credit in developing countries requires collateral.  As a result, entry rates are low. [1]"
firm exit rate,"In a certain industry, the firm exit rate in a given period of time is the number of firms that ceased operations during that period, divided by the total number of firms that operated during the same period. Exit rates measure churning in an industry, meaning the pace at which the identity of producers change over time. The significance of this pace cannot be evaluated in general as it depends on a variety of factors. A high exit rate is not necessarily bad news. Many economists see exit as part of the virtuous process by which plant, property, equipment and workers are transferred from failing businesses to the most efficient producers. In a competitive market, the efficiency gains from such reallocation translate into lower consumer prices. ExampleIn the second half of the 1970s, Chile started a large programme of economic reforms, which included trade liberalisation, privatisation of state firms and market deregulation. The large increase in exit rates that ensued allowed for workers and capital employed by inefficient businesses to be transferred to more efficient ones. Also, the big rise in exit rates is credited for a large portion of the increase in the standard of living experienced by Chile. [1]"

fiscal cliff,"This refers to the simultaneous expiry of tax breaks and the introduction of tax increases and spending cuts that were due at the end of 2012, the cumulation of which were expected push the US back into recession.   fiscal cliff in the news Among the fallout feared   if Congress failed to reach a deal before December 31 (2012)   was a significant increase in taxation on investment income, with tax rates on capital gains set to increase from 15 per cent to 20 per cent, and tax rates on dividends slated to rise to 39.6 per cent for top earners. Adding a 3.8 per cent surtax on investment income for the wealthiest Americans   those with adjusted gross income (AGI) of more than $250,000 for joint filers and $200,000 for single filers   was part of the 2010 health reform law and was due to take effect in 2013. It meant tax rates on capital gains would rise to 23.8 per cent, while those on dividends would increase to 43.4 per cent for the highest earners. If Congress took no action by January 1, the US would be hit by a fiscal contraction worth $600bn in 2013, which could tip the economy into a new recession. The fiscal drag results from the expiry of a series of Bush-era tax cuts, as well as the scheduled entry into force of automatic cuts to defence and domestic spending programmes. At roughly the same time, US lawmakers would have to raise its borrowing limit, or face the risk that the country could default on its debt. In fact a compromise was reached on January 1 and higher income tax rates were agreed for the wealthy. However, the tougher decisions on spending cuts were expected to fought over for months to come. In September 2013 a new deadline of the middle of October was approaching. The White House, under president Barack Obama, was determined not to give ground, but if agreement to raise the borrowing authority could not be reached with Congress the US faced a new threat of default on its debt obligations. At the beginning of October 2013 the US shutdown had started, resulting in the closing of numerous government agencies. But an FT report found that the risk of US default on $1.2tn of outstanding government bonds was worrying markets far more than the shutdown.

flexible trust,"A trust whose funds can be invested in any type of shares etc, within agreed limits. [1] "
flexible working,"Flexible working gives employees flexibility on how long, where and when they work. Employees access flexible working through human resources policies, which usually require supervisory approval. Flexible working is comprised of three main arrangements: full-time, part-time and career flexibility. Full-time flexible options include:   Flexible hours (flextime) - the ability to choose      the start and finish time of the working day within core hours;  Telework (flexplace) - the chance to work from      home or another place one or several days a week; Time banks - the ability to take time off in      compensation for overtime; Compressed work weeks - such as working four      longer days and taking the fifth day of the week off, or working a nine      day fortnight.  Part-time options include working a few days a week, say three days instead of the traditional five days, and other forms such as v-time-working. The ""v"" stands for voluntary reduced hours, with the individual working to an agreed reduced schedule for a certain period, for example during the school holidays, with the chance to work the usual hours after that period ends. Job-sharing is also an interesting form of part-time flexible working where two people share a full-time position, either by working three days each in the week with one day of overlap or they alternate one week each. Career flexibility (flex career) allows individuals to change careers and/or take career breaks for personal or family reasons without suffering career penalties. Career flexibility involves challenging the traditional career ladder of containing a continuously upward path with workers likely to fall back to the bottom of the career ladder if they change their careers. Instead, a career lattice can be organised where individuals may take different paths, including lateral ones, and career breaks. Career flexibility also includes a gradual return from maternity leave, for instance, returning part-time for a certain period then going full-time afterwards. Career flexibility also includes gradual phasing into retirement such as going from full-time to part-time for a certain period and then retirement. Examples At Accenture in France, employees may work from home one to three days a week if their supervisor agrees to the arrangement. In 2011, fifty percent of support functions staff currently work from home. The arrangement includes supervisor training on virtual management and a grievance procedure in case supervisors reject the request to work from home. With the telework agreement at Accenture, employee satisfaction with work-life balance has soared.  Deloitte and Touche allows employees to leave the organisation for up to five years to pursue personal interests such as raising children or training for a sporting activity.

At Hewlett Packard in Grenoble, France, there are VP positions filled by two people in a job share, where both partners get evaluated and promoted as a pair.

flexitime,"A system in which people work a fixed number of hours each week or month, but can change the times at which they start and finish each day. [1] "
flexpatriate,"An employee who takes up an international assignment centered on frequent international business travel without relocating abroad. The name 'flexpatriate' comes from the need for a level of flexibility on the part of the individual traveling to pick up and go in response to business requiring face-to-face and in-person contact. These arrangements are also referred to as 'frequent flyer assignments'. The major difference between traditional expatriate assignments and flexpatriate assignments is that relocation of the employee and his or her family is not necessary. An employee travels from the domestic location to other parts of the world to conduct global business and then returns home shortly thereafter. Flexpatriate assignments have been regarded as a viable alternative to the challenge of employee unwillingness to relocate abroad due to family or personal reasons. For employees, they represent a way to gain valuable business experience abroad while still maintaining a home base. However, flexpatriate assignments can potentially bring difficult conditions to employees such as health ailments from constant travel, social isolation, and work and family strain. There is some evidence that a satisfactory global work-life balance can be achieved when organisations allow employees flexibility in organizing their travel plans and also afford them discretion in using technology to manage communication with business and personal contacts. The impact on the lives of flexpatriates over the long-term is still unclear. Example Flexpatriate or frequent flyer assignments tend to be more prevalent than expatriate assignments today. However, it is not often clear to what extent flexpat assignments exist in an organisation, as they may not always be formalised or labeled as such. It may be viewed as worldwide travel that is executed as part of the basic job description. And, it could be that an employee's immediate manager or supervisor is aware of the nature of the global work performed in the job (specifically here, frequent international travel) and not HR. HR specialists in an organization would typically be the ones charged with classifying this type of work assignment in terms of an overall strategy for employee career development. [1]"

followership,"The concept of followership first appeared relatively recently and silently in the leadership literature. We always focus on leaders, their competencies, their characteristics and their profile, but very seldom do we focus on followers. Followership is the ability to follow others. Followership is not an obvious characteristic at all. It means accepting that another person has valuable abilities in a specific domain that prompt others to follow them. It requires accepting  difference  and accepting that others can be better in particular aspects. The followership concept is especially important in family businesses, because quite often the problem is not a lack of leadership but a lack of  followership  (i.e. I can follow anyone but my brother/cousin). It is the follower who avoids the leadership, in spite of the leader s qualities. The main obstacle to developing followership is rivalry. Rivalry appears in family businesses when someone is forced to  be equal . This happens between siblings in a family business. Family equality is translated into the business, and each sibling competes to avoid being less than the others. Therefore, they are unable to follow each other. A family business without followership in the family group has a limited future.[1]"

forced liquidation,The same as compulsory liquidation.
forced savings,"When people spend less than they earn because there are not enough goods available to buy or because goods are too expensive. [1] Forced saving plays an important role in explaining how expansionary monetary policy generate artificial booms. Forced saving is unlike when someone decides to put some of their income into a savings account or other form of investment. There are two things to note. Firstly, the reduction in their present consumption is voluntary   they are happy to exchange present consumption for increased future consumption. Secondly, this will constitute an increase in the supply of loanable funds, and thereby push interest rates down. By contrast a credit expansion by the central bank will also lower interest rates, but this has not stemmed from more real resources available for investment, and will also reduce the purchasing power of those who hold money. These are  savings  in the sense that people's ability to consume is reduced, and  forced  in the sense that it is involuntary. Forced savings therefore creates two major problems. Firstly, it has distributional effects in terms of who receives the new money (and enjoys an increase in purchasing power) and who doesn t. Secondly, the tension between the signal being sent to entrepreneurs and the real resources that are available to fund investment is the essence of the boom bust cycle. At some point the investments that are funded through  forced  savings will be revealed as errors, and the liquidation process is what constitutes a recession. [2]"

foreign direct investment,"Investment from one country into another (normally by companies rather than governments) that involves establishing operations or acquiring tangible assets, including stakes in other businesses. [1] The purchase or establishment of income-generating assets in a foreign country that entails the control of the operation or organisation. FDI is distinguished from portfolio foreign investment (the purchase of one country s securities by nationals of another country) by the element of control. Standard definitions of control use the internationally agreed 10 per cent threshold of voting shares, but this is a grey area as often a smaller block of shares will give control in widely held companies.  Moreover, control of technology, management, even crucial inputs can confer de facto control. FDI is not just a transfer of ownership as it usually involves the transfer of factors complementary to capital, including management, technology and organisational skills. ExampleStrategically FDI comes in three types: - Horizontal: where the company carries out the same activities abroad as at home (for example, Toyota assembling cars in both Japan and the UK.  - Vertical: when different stages of activities are added abroad. Forward vertical FDI is where the FDI takes the firm nearer to the market (for example, Toyota acquiring a car distributorship in America) and Backward Vertical FDI is where international integration moves back towards raw materials (for example, Toyota acquiring a tyre manufacturer or a rubber plantation).  - Conglomerate: where an unrelated business is added abroad. This is the most unusual form of FDI as it involves attempting to overcome two barriers simultaneously - entering a foreign country and a new industry.  This leads to the analytical solution that internationalisation and diversification are often alternative strategies, not complements. FDI can take the form of greenfield entry or takeover. Greenfield entry implies assembling all the elements from scratch as Honda did in the UK, whereas foreign takeover means the acquisition of an existing foreign company - as Tata s acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover illustrates. Foreign takeover is often covered by the term 'mergers and acquisitions  (M&As;) but internationally, mergers are vanishingly small, accounting for less than 1 per cent of all foreign acquisitions. This choice of entry mode interacts with ownership strategy   the choice of wholly owned subsidiaries versus joint ventures to give a 2x2 matrix of choices   greenfield wholly owned ventures, greenfield joint ventures, wholly owned takeovers and joint foreign acquisitions - giving foreign investors choices that they can match to their own capabilities and foreign conditions.

Forex, or FX, trading takes place in a decentralised global market. The physical location of the trading depends on the time of day and which participants are awake. Trading in the forex market takes place between dealers. One dealer will ask another for a bid/ask quote and then decide whether to trade. Demand for currencies from agents that choose to deal with a particular dealer (the dealer's customers) can help inform the dealer's bid/ask quote decisions. Interdealer trading also takes place indirectly through brokerages or banks that act as intermediaries between dealers.   forex in the news In May 2013 it was reported that a study had shown investment banks can make windfall profits by copying customers' foreign exchange trades raising fresh concerns about the lack of transparency in the world's largest financial market. The report referred to the Euromoney 2012 FX survey that found that the biggest banks in forex, including Deutsche Bank and Citigroup, were investing heavily in their own trading platforms in an attempt to woo clients from multi-dealer or third-party products. It also found that the top five banks' share of global forex trading had risen from 45 per cent in 2002 to more than 57 per cent in 2012."

Forensic accountants are also used in fraud investigations.   forensic accounting in the news Maryam Kennedy, interviewed for the FT in June 2012, was reported to have clocked up more than 14 years experience in complex global investigations and since 2010 had been a partner with the Fraud Investigation and Dispute Services practice at Ernst & Young, a global forensic team of 1,700 people.  In June 2013, an FT columnist reported on a new exchange traded fund   the Flag ETF, which excludes the 100 companies in the S&P; 500 that take the worst grades for aggressive accounting.

forward guidance,"Forward guidance is the term used by central banks to communicate what their future monetary policy will be. By using forward guidance, banks aim to calm uncertainty in markets and corporations. For example, if markets or company owners fear that low interest rates will move higher, interest rates on bonds and other credit instruments and agreements will rise and begin to discourage people and companies from taking out loans or spending money. If a central bank is able to transparently signal that it intends to keep rates low (if that is its intention), the market response will be appropriate to its overall policy. Economists sometimes refer to two broad forms of forward guidance: Delphic and Odyssian. In the classic Delphic version of forward guidance the central bank states its economic outlook without any further commitment. This form of forward guidance tends to affect short term interest rates.  However, when the short term rate has a natural floor at zero, or is at the ""zero lower bound"", a stronger signal is needed from central banks if they want to stimulate their economies. Odyssian forward guidance at the zero bound involves trying to convince markets that once the economy eventually recovers you won't move interest rates straight away and will instead wait for longer before responding to rising inflation and growth. This raises the disposable income of borrowers encouraging more activity in the economy.   forward guidance in the news In July 2013 the Bank of England and the European Central Bank decided to act to rein in the recent rise in market interest rates and tied any future rise in interest rates to economic and financial conditions. , faced dissent from within the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) when he announced his forward guidance policy - his big idea to improve the UK economy. In August 2013, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, decided to be more explicit about forward guidance stating in what was said to be one of the most substantial changes to the UK s monetary policy framework since the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee became independent in 1997. He indicated that he would look at raising rates should unemployment fall to below 7 per cent. In January 2014 UK borrowing costs shot up after a report from the Office of National Statistics showed the rate of unemployment had fallen to 7.1 per cent in the three months to the end of October. A few days later, Mark Carney signalled the end of his forward guidance of linking interest rates to the unemployment rate, adding that the British economy was in a different place to where it had been in the previous summer.

forward price,"The fixed price offered for buying a currency or commodity (oil, metal, farm product etc) for delivery on a fixed date in the future. [1] "
forward rate,"The term forward rate is commonly used in both bond and currency trading to express today's expectation of the future value of either a currency or a bond. In bond trading the forward rate is an implied rate calculated from current interest rates on various bond maturities. In theory, it would allow an investor to buy a five year Treasury bond and hold it to maturity, or to buy a one year Treasury and hold it to maturity and repeat the process every year for five years. In practice, it turns out that forward rates tend to be higher than the spot rate that ultimately prevails. In other words, holding longer term bonds will deliver higher average returns. In currency trading, a forward rate is the rate at which a trader agrees to exchange one currency for another at a set future date.    forward rates in the news In August 2012, writers in the FT wondered if it might be time to find a more realistic discount rate for pensions that uses expectations about the future rather than data from the past. The writers said: ""To a rough approximation, we can measure future expectations by calculating the forward interest rate on risk-free assets, such as US Treasuries or UK gilts. This forward rate, adjusted for the historic spread between Treasuries or gilts and the relevant corporate bond yields, might be a reasonable reflection of expected risk-free returns in the future."" In January 2012, enthusiasm for the renminbi had dimmed. A writer commented that, the spot rate and the 12-month forward rate for the renminbi against the US dollar were about the same at about 6.32, leading to less appetite for renminbi deposits."

The process causes the rock to fracture and allows recovery of shale gas and shale oil, otherwise known as ""tight oil"", that was trapped in the rock. Fracking enables wells that would flow only at very low rates to produce oil and gas in commercially viable volumes.[1] Fracking has been criticised by environmentalists mainly because of concerns that it can contaminate underground water, but also due to other issues.   fracking in the news In April 2011 a gas well in Pennsylvania in the US exploded sending thousands of gallons of fluids laced with chemicals through the drilling site and into a local tributary.

fragile middle,"The fragile middle is a term adopted by the FT to refer to some 2.8bn middle class people in emerging economies who are vulnerable to ebbing fortunes. In a series of the same name the FT defined the Fragile Middle as being those people in the world earning between $2 and $10 a day. Using the World Bank's Povcal database, the FT found that 40 per cent of the world's population fell into that bracket with almost 1bn of them existing on $2-$3 per day. Consideration of what happens to the Fragile Middle was seen as important because multinational companies fortunes' depend of the rise of a global middle class.    Fragile Middle in the news At the end of April 2014, Branko Milanovic, an academic writing in the Financial Times, looked at the problem of income inequality and pointed out that people moving from absolute poverty (defined as $1.25 a day) to the ranks of those who are marginally better off had created a false impression. It would be more accurate, he said, to consider those whose incomes were 25 per cent below the median and 25 per cent above (in other words, those earning between $4 and $6.5 a day). By this measure, he wrote, only 13 per cent of the world population qualified. Even by that more prosperous measure the middle class were vulnerable, he said.

franchising,"Franchising is a mode of distribution of goods and services by which an independent businessperson (franchisee) obtains from a parent company (chain operator) the right to market goods or services under its brand name and to use its business practices. In return, the franchisee pays an up-front fee and ongoing royalties to the chain operator. There are two main reasons for the success of franchising:  Chain operators do not always have internal access to the resources needed to open and operate outlets. Franchising is a way for them to get access to such resources. Unlike employee-managers, franchisees are independent entrepreneurs who invest their own capital in their outlet. Since the profit stream from their investment largely depends on the performance of their outlets, they tend to work harder than employee-managers. The rationale is that people tend to work harder when their compensation is tightly related to their actual performance. As the compensation of franchisees is directly tied to the performance of their outlets, they have stronger incentives to perform.  Though franchising has many advantages, it is not a panacea.  A major issue associated with the management of franchisees is that franchisees may behave opportunistically. In franchising, chain operators are responsible for improving the product/ service mix and promoting the brand. If their efforts are sufficient to attract a steady stream of customers, franchisees may be tempted to increase their short-term profitability by letting quality standards slip such as under-investing in advertising and training. There are also important differences between chain operators and franchisees in terms of priorities. Generally, while developing and promoting the chain and brand name in the long run is more important for chain operators than franchisees, profitability in the short run is generally more important for franchisees than chain operators.

There is no single definition of what constitutes an  exceptional  growth rate, but 20% and more per annum is a common definition.

Some consider as potential gazelles only fast-growing companies which have already reached some turnover threshold, for example, $10m.Gazelles are quite scarce in most economies, comprising about 5% - and at the most 10% - of all new entrants in a given cohort entry. They are of major political and economic interest because they are seen as potential large employers and wealth creators of the future.  However, research shows that most gazelles have a major problem sustaining growth over more than five years.ExampleHigh-tech and internet companies furnish many examples of gazelles such as Microsoft, Apple, Dell, Yahoo, Google and Cisco were all gazelles in their earlier days.

gender mainstreaming,"Gender mainstreaming was introduced to the European Union in 1997.  It was heralded as a new strategy for achieving gender equality in employment within Europe. The idea of gender mainstreaming comes from feminist theoretical and political activism, which has sought to make equality between women and men central to state policy.  The formal adoption of gender mainstreaming policy by the European Union raised hopes among feminists.  However, well over a decade after it was introduced, the impact of gender mainstreaming on inequalities at work in Europe has been limited. Partly this is because, despite the importance of equality agendas, economics and notions of competitive advantage within organization still tend to override policy concerns about gender equalities.   gender mainstreaming in the news In the context of European employment, the main objective of gender mainstreaming has been to address long-standing inequalities such as the gender pay gap which continues to exist between women and men workers. However, in March 2012 it was reported that the UK Office of National Statistics had found the gender pay gap in the UK to be larger than previously thought with women's hourly pay found to be on average 10.5 per cent below that of men.

general anti-abuse rule  GAAR,"A general anti abuse rule (GAAR)   a set of broad and general principles-based rules enacted in the tax code aimed at counteracting avoidance of tax   was introduced for certain transactions entered into on or after 17 July 2013. It supplements the current series of targeted anti avoidance rules (TAARs) which aim to prevent tax avoidance in specific areas of the legislation. The GAAR is targeted at flagrant abusive and artificial schemes. There is a different Scottish general anti avoidance rule that will apply to land and buildings transactions tax and Scottish landfill tax from April 2015. A number of other jurisdictions (e.g. Australia, Canada) have a general anti-avoidance rule (also referred to as a GAAR) and generally the provisions have broader application than the targeted UK GAAR.

generation X,The group of people who are between about 20 and 35 years old. [1]
generation Y,"                           Globally, generation Y (gen Y) refers broadly to the demographic cohort born between 1975 and 1995. The group is seen as reliant on new media and digital technology with short attention spans.  They expect entertaining and fast-paced information and are assumed to be self-centred, demanding, and hard to integrate into teams. However, beware assuming that generations are comparable across national and cultural boundaries. In much of the West, one speaks of baby boomers, generation X (gen X) and Y, assuming more or less standard birthdates for the cohorts. In China, Japan and South Korea, during the same time span of 1940-2000, one has respectively 6, 6, and 4 generational groups, all defined differently and with different names and birth periods. It would be a vast oversimplification to assume that gen Y in China is equivalent to gen Y in the US, Germany or South Korea, despite their sharing some traits such as being highly connected via social networking sites. Employers seeking to understand how to best attract, retain and manage their young talent ignore these differences at their peril. Across Europe and East Asia, organisations of all types and sectors worry that there are not enough educated members of gen Y to replace the older generation as it retires. Other places such as India and the Middle East are demographically younger but some of their young are undereducated. It is therefore crucial that organisations learn how to best manage and engage gen Y. As consumers, gen Y attracts much attention from market researchers who have realised early on that the group itself has different values, such as placing emphasis on environmental issues, but in other respects gen Y varies between countries. Example Cases of successfully adapting to gen Y employees include a consumer goods company asking a group of gen Y staff to develop its on-boarding or induction training programme for new hires.  The staff developed a popular course using touch screens for questionnaires and cartoon figures as programme guides. Also an internet company devised a HR system that looks like a video game rather than consisting of forms.

geolocation,"Describes a variety of tools that allow users to record their physical location through social media or apps.Geolocation can be used in a number of different ways.  One common method is to annotate other social media platforms with location-based data. For example, Twitter allows you to record your location when you write a tweet. There are also whole platforms or platform components designed entirely around geolocation, including FourSquare and Facebook.  These are platforms based around the idea of users  checking in  when they arrive at various locations to let their friends and contacts know where they are at that moment. Foursquare is a social networking site that encourages people to explore their local area. Example With the proliferation of GPS-enabled smartphones, such as Apple s iPhone and Android mobile phones, companies have increasingly looked toward geolocation technology for marketing purposes. For example, they advertise to consumers who are using their smart phones based on their location. FourSquare provides the ability for companies to give discounts and promotions to consumers who  check in  at their location, and even advertise to consumers who are just  in the neighborhood.

He noted there had been an outcry in 2012 when there were proposals to merge the British Antarctic Survey, which spends about 1 per cent of the UK's science budget, with the National Oceanography Centre. The idea was dropped after quiet political lobbying, which  pointed out it might be unwise to lose the BAS whose official mission includes sustaining the UK s  active and influential Antarctic regional presence, and a leadership role in Antarctic affairs . In March 2013, the geopolitics of natural resources looked as though it was going to get a shake-up as China overtook the US as the world's largest importer of oil.     "
get-out clause,Another name for an escape clause. [1] 
gharar,"An Arabic word meaning risk, uncertainty, or hazard. Financial products where details concerning the conditions of sale are unknown or uncertain are generally prohibited under Islamic law. Thus, all contracts should be devoid of uncertainty and speculation and parties must have perfect knowledge of the terms of exchange. In particular, the identification of the owner of the goods must be disclosed. ""You cannot sell what you do not possess"" is the main rationale behind the prohibition of short selling. In modern terms, it means that derivative products should be prohibited because the buyer pays in advance for something he is not guaranteed to receive. Conversely, some kind of gharar is accepted when it comes to forward contracts provided that payment and actual delivery are secured. The istina contract would be used for the purchase in advance (usually in instalments) of commodities on the ground of necessity, while the salam contracts would have the same utility but the payment must be fully paid in advance and price, quality, quantity and period of delivery are specified at the time of transaction in order to avoid uncertainty.[1]"

gilt stock,Bonds sold by the British government to raise money. [1] 
gilt strip,"Gilts are, very simply, units of debt issued by the government. When buying them, you are effectively lending money to the government, which promises to pay back the amount in full (known as the principal) at a set date, along with interest (known as the coupon). A conventional 'gilt-edged security' is the simplest and oldest form of government stock. The bond pays out half the annual coupon every six months until the maturity date, when the final coupon payment and principal (the initial investment) are paid to the holder in full. In the UK in 1997, the government started to issue a form of gilt-edged security called a Strip - this stands for Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities. This is effectively a zero-coupon bond that is sold at a discount to the nominal value. Strips are separately traded non-interest bearing bonds with all the return derived from the capital appreciation that results as the bond reaches maturity. With a Strip, you might think that you can escape the eye of the Inland Revenue (IR), but all gains from gilt Strips are effectively taxed as income on an annual basis. Holders are deemed to have ""bed and breakfasted"" the Strip if they hold it from one year to the next, and any resulting gains (or losses) are taxed as income. Effectively, the IR deems that the holder sells the stock at the closing price on 5 April, and repurchases the same security on 6 April.  With this in mind, Strips are only really suitable for those investors who are both capital-rich and low-rate tax payers, and who do not need any ongoing income payments.

global career,"In the past, the term international career was used by scholars to indicate building a career based on periods abroad and at home, typically between two countries. However, with globalisation linking business across multiple countries simultaneously and the proliferation of different ways of doing global work, the term global career is more distinct and is more prevalent. A broad definition of a global career is a career based on international experience gained over time through performing work with global responsibilities and cross-cultural exposure. What we know about global careers to date has largely been based on individuals going abroad on an organisation-sponsored work assignment. Most research on the topic is not necessarily examining the work experience contextualised within a larger global career. However, researchers have begun to examine the notion of global careers as developing across multiple assignments over a long-term horizon. Global careers also can be initiated by individuals themselves in the form of self-initiated work assignments abroad. While working abroad (for example, on an expatriate assignment) might enhance overall career advancement, it is unclear to what degree pursuing a career that is considered global requires ongoing international mobility. Example An employee pursuing a global career today differs from the image of older, male  jet-setting  corporate managers or expats from the past. Younger employees of both genders are increasingly building their careers in a global context. This evolution in the profile of a global careerist can be due to a shift toward the importance of global experience in organisational career development, as well as a growing prevalence of global aspects in many jobs today. [1]"
global citizen,"Global citizenship is a trait or characteristic in our definition of a global leader. Global leaders are global citizens because they recognise that the prosperity of one individual, one company or one nation is interdependent with the prosperity of others. This idea that one s responsibilities transcend geography or political borders is at the heart of global citizenship. Global leaders become global citizens as they recognize that global business norms are emerging and that their actions play a role in shaping them. Where current practice undermines shared prosperity, global citizens work to change it. In their organisations, when global citizens that identify a practice that is considered offensive or unacceptable in one location, they will act to see that it is banned globally.  While they may look globally for opportunities to drive down costs, when it comes to values and global business practices, global citizens endeavor to level up to the higher standard. Example Alan Boeckmann, former CEO of the construction giant Fluor Corporation, is an example of a global citizen. Frustrated by the prevalence of corruption in the construction industry and dismayed by the impact corruption had on the communities in which Fluor operated, Boeckmann led his industry colleagues at the World Economic Forum to create the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative or PACI. PACI is built on the understanding that there is both a demand and supply side in the corruption equation and that business controls the supply. Through industry collaboration, PACI creates an anti-corruption cartel whose goal is to shut off the flow of illicit payments and bribes in order to alter the way business is done in corrupt markets. PACI is helping to establish anti-corruption as a global business norm in an effort to eliminate the corrosive practice of bribery and its economically damaging consequences. [1]"

global entrepreneur,"Global entrepreneurship is a trait or characteristic in our definition of a global leader. Global entrepreneurs are professionals who use their global understanding and connections to identify transnational and cross-cultural opportunities and turn them into new value-creating initiative. While entrepreneurship usually means the creation of a new business, the scope of many global leaders' efforts go beyond business creation. Value creation obviously happens in established companies every day and many global leaders act as intrapreneurs pursuing opportunities from within an organisational context. Furthermore the term global entrepreneur recognises that not only businesses create new value - many global entrepreneurs operate from within the non-profit world establishing international social enterprises. Global entrepreneurs typically create value in three distinct ways: - The first is by tapping into commonalities   or convergence - between markets and cultures. This approach is common for organisations trying to bring a standard brand promise to diverse cultures, such as global brands Nike or McDonald s. Alternatively it is companies like Intel that are bringing broadly applicable, convergent technological solutions to diverse communities. - Conversely, global entrepreneurs may tap differences   or divergence - among regions in order to access distinct comparative advantages. Some IKEA products, for example, are designed in Sweden and assembled in China using African cotton and Polish plywood.  - Global entrepreneurs also access networks and create value by building platforms that allow global exchange.  Hong Kong-based Global Sources, for example, uses a standard trading platform to facilitate exchange between suppliers in Asia and clients around the world.  Example Lalit Ahuja, director of Target India, acts as a global entrepreneur within the context of his organization. His effort have ensured that the advantage Target gains from its Indian operation is not mere low-cost commodity services and labor, although such activity is an example of tapping regional divergence. Ahuja s work has also focused on creating shared platforms and network for high value activities.  According to Ahuja, in the companies he worked for prior to Target he found an obsessive focus on cultural difference.  I spent a lot of time managing perceptions and educating people on both sides of the ocean on how to work across cultures,  he says.  It was unproductive and ultimately produced work that wasn t relevant.  In building Target s Indian headquarters he took a different tack. He placed the emphasis, not on cultural differences, but on forging a shared corporate culture with Target s headquarters. In Ahuja s words, it was critical that everyone who worked for Target was  the same shade of red"". This common cultural platform ensures that the true value Target India is the ability it gives Target to pursue high-value initiatives 24 hours a day, handing projects between time zones across a shared cultural platform. The first major project undertaken by Target India, for instance, was leading the high profile redesign of a Target store in Arizona. [1]"
global financial crisis,"A global financial crisis refers to a situation when, for reasons that may not necessarily grounded in accurate information or apparent logic, parties to financial contracts in many nations simultaneously conclude that the contracts they hold are unlikely be honoured by counterparties or that the financial assets that they hold are likely to be worth substantially less than previously thought. As a result these parties, such as banks, typically cease to advance funds to others, demand early repayment of loans and other financial instruments, liquidate holdings of financial assets that can be sold, increase collateral requirements etc to a degree that is outside the prior expectations of market participants. The result is what is often referred to as  frozen  financial markets, where trading volumes fall considerably and parties often cannot be induced to trade financial instruments no matter what prices are offered.   Private individuals, fearing for their wealth, contribute to such crises by demanding that banks and other financial institutions repay as much as possible and typically seek to hold accepted stores of value, such as gold and cash. Meeting their customers  demands causes banks and other financial institutions to call in their loans and to liquidate holdings of financial assets, further adding to the downward pressure on prices of financial assets, which in turn impairs the balance sheets of financial institutions. Like national financial crises, once a global financial crisis gets under way in the absence of credible, verifiable information about the viability of financial institutions, fear   more generally, expectations   alone can accelerate the selling of financial assets, the collapse of asset prices, and ultimately, the freezing up of financial markets. It is for this reason that financial crises are often associated with much talk of the need to  restore confidence  in affected financial markets and institutions. A wide range of financial assets can be subject to such simultaneous  loss of confidence  including stocks, government bonds, bank deposits, asset backed securities, and insurance contracts. It would be wrong, therefore, to associate global financial crises with deficiencies in any one type of financial counterparty, such as governments, or with sharp falls in the values of any one type of financial asset, such as stocks.[1] A global financial crisis can, but need not, result in a global economic crisis. In modern economies, where working capital is needed to tide firms over from the time when they incur costs for parts, supplies, and staff to the time when they receive revenues, the subsequent withdrawal of credit creates the potential for widespread corporate bankruptcies. A financial market breakdown, then, can quickly create a severe downturn in economic activity, involving falls in national income and increases in unemployment that are in excess of those witnessed during traditional economic recessions. That these dynamics can play out simultaneously in many jurisdictions implies that, left unchecked, a global financial crisis can result in a global economic crisis, an example of which is the Great Depression of the 1930s. The transmission of the financial and economic shock from one nation to another is accelerated in an era of substantial cross-border flows of financial capital, goods, and services. These cross-border linkages further depress an economy suffering from a financial crisis. There are four primary channels of so-called contagion, the first three of which are private sector driven. First, losses on financial assets held abroad can trigger losses in confidence in the financial institutions at home that made those investments. Second, financial market participants in one country may raise their assessment of certain adverse risks taking place there in the light of recent developments in other nations, reasoning that certain pertinent circumstances are common. An example is, in the aftermath of Thailand succumbing to a financial crisis in July 1997, asset prices and currencies in other southeast Asian nations were marked down in value because of perceived commonalities in institutional and governance structures. Whether such assessments were correct is immaterial. That many firms supply customers abroad provides another means by which severe economic downturns can spread across borders, as falling exports reduce the national incomes. This trade-related channel has grown in importance with the development of international supply chains, where reductions in sales of a final good can produce cuts in orders for foreign sourced parts and components worth multiples of the original transaction. This has been referred to as the bullwhip effect and was thought to account for part of the sharp fall in global trade witnessed in 2009. The fourth reason why financial and economic crises can spread across borders is because of government policies that seek to bolster the domestic economy at the expense of other nations. Such beggar-thy-neighbour policies include raising tariffs and other trade barriers, devaluing national currencies, insisting that domestic financial institutions repatriate financial asset holdings from abroad, restricting government contracts to domestic firms, subsidising exports so as to win contracts abroad at the expense of firms located in trading partners, and taxing foreign firms and workers worse than rival domestic firms, amongst others. Even though a key feature of a global financial crisis is the simultaneous freezing up of some financial markets, cross-country differences in asset holdings, debts, and the business cycle, as well as differences in the speed with which shocks are transmitted from one nation to another imply that phases can often be discerned in any resulting global economic crisis.   The 2008 to 2009 Global Financial Crisis unfolds Several phases[2] can be identified in the Global Financial Crisis that took hold in September 2008, which is frequently attributed to the collapse of US investment bank, Lehman Brothers, although many other financial markets had begun to malfunction before that time.[3] The recessions experienced in many economies and the growth slowdown that followed the Global Financial Crisis are often referred to as elements of the Great Recession. Before Lehman Brothers collapsed, the effects of sharp revaluations in the prices of lower quality US mortgage-backed securities (often referred to as subprime mortgages) began to be felt in other countries (notably in Europe) from the third quarter of 2007, and is often associated with the first phase of recent global crisis. In fact, it was only around the time of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which ultimately the US government had refused to bail out, that resulted in such fears of counterparty risk that transactions on financial markets almost dried up in the third and fourth quarters of 2008. The shortage of working capital causes desperate firms to liquidate stocks, slash purchases of parts and components, and fire staff. Trade finance became scarce and falling purchases by firms and consumers international trade began to plummet. Claiming that they had learned the lessons of the 1930s, governments and central banks took aggressive steps to stabilise national economies. This second phase of the crisis involved interest rates being cut to almost zero, liquidity being made available in substantial quantities to financial market institutions, purchases of a range of financial assets by central banks, and the implementation of large fiscal stimulus packages. The stabilisation phase started in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continued through to the end of 2009. Convinced that the worst was over and expecting that national incomes would recover in 2010[4], fears arose that stimulus packages, if continued, would create unsustainable public debts, which in turn would induce falling bond prices and rising medium and longer term interest rates. Since many such bonds were owned by banks and pension funds it was feared that unless steps were taken to reduce government borrowing then falls in the value of government bonds would risk the solvency of these private sector financial institutions. This is the first example during the crisis of what became known as bank-sovereign linkages, implying that their fates could be linked. From 2010 on, then, the third phase of the crisis began with austerity plans announced involving, in principle, tax increases and government spending cuts. These measures were controversial, as some thought that their implementation was premature given national economies had not returned to their previous growth paths. Still, it was argued that austerity, coupled with structural reforms[5] to raise the long run rate of growth of economies would raise expectations of future tax levels and allay fears about the long term solvency of governments. Austerity was combined in many industrialised economies with higher rates of personal saving as individuals sought to pay down their debts and to rebuild their financial portfolios. Sharp falls in housing prices in some jurisdictions plus the effects of holding foreign financial assets that had fallen considerably in value implied that many banks held substantial bad debts. During the process of recognising and writing off these bad debts bank lending for new projects was depressed. The combination of austerity, deleveraging, and rebuilding bank balance sheets meant that economic growth fell below projections for many large economies during the years 2010 to 2012.[6] Public and expert discontent with austerity measures grew. Although the International Monetary Fund began publicly questioning austerity in the third quarter of 2012[7], it was not until 2013 that austerity policies were called into question by previous adherents (such as the President of the European Commission) and demoted, if not abandoned. This led to the fourth and latest phase of the crisis, where the emphasis is on structural reforms, including not just banking reforms but also labour and product market reforms. In the Eurozone countries, concerns about the solvency of several governments reached such heights that they added another dimension to the global financial crisis.[8] The governments of Greece, Ireland, Malta, and Portugal were unable to borrow from the financial markets and sought bailouts from the Troika, the IMF, the European Commission, and the European Central Banks. EU member states and the IMF put up the funds for the bailouts. Greece needed several bailout packages, the last of which saw a large portion of its government debt written off. In July 2012 Spain agreed to a  100bn deal with the European Central Bank to bailout out that country s banks, it being believed that the Spanish government did not have the resources to do so. When fears reached their peak that the governments of Italy and Spain, two much larger economies,  may not be able to sell enough government bonds, on 26 July 2012 the President of the European Central Bank threatened to intervene as aggressively as necessary to keep yields on those bonds down. Since then the interest rates on Italy and Spain s government debts have fluctuated in a relatively stable range.[1]    [1] For an account of the different types of financial crises see http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp1328.pdf   [2] For a timeline of the crisis through 2010 see http://lauder.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/pdf/class_info/Chronology_Economic_Financial_Crisis.pdf   [3] http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/44968962-ca35-11dd-93e5-000077b07658.html   [4] http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b31c06a2-5a7a-11de-8c14-00144feabdc0.html   [5] http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c80b0d2c-4377-11e1-8489-00144feab49a.html   [6] http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7017ee50-2581-11e1-9cb0-00144feabdc0.html   [7] http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2013/01/the-imf-we-were-right-about-being-wrong-but-normally-we-arent/   [8] http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0c382c9c-0237-11e0-aa40-00144feabdc0.html  "
global financial system,"This is the interplay of financial companies, regulators and institutions operating on a supranational level.  The global financial system can be divided into regulated entities (international banks and insurance companies), regulators, supervisors and institutions like the European Central Bank or the International Monetary Fund. The system also includes the lightly regulated or non-regulated bodies - this is known as the  shadow banking  system.  Mainly, this covers hedge funds, private equity and bank sponsored entities such as off-balance-sheet vehicles that banks use to invest in the financial markets. ExampleAs banks lend money to governments, hedge funds and private equity firms, and central banks lend money to commercial and investment banks, the interrelationship between these loans creates the global  systemic  risk, which explains why a  local  crisis such as the US subprime meltdown in 2007 translated into a global financial crisis. [1]"
global fund,"Fund that invests in securities traded around the world, including in the US."
global governance,"Global standards are currently being made by four categories of international players: - the private sector (firms, professional associations, funds, banks) - multilateral organisations - non-state organisations (NGOs, unions, private and professional standard producers, think-tanks) - states. Global governance takes either the form of 'positive law' after a lobbying process (for example the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions) or the form of 'soft law', directly by the abovementioned, alone or together. This is the case of 'best practice' documentation for example. Breaking this informal law exposes to 'naming and shaming' from by NGOs and public opinion. It should also be noted that standards producing has become a profitable business in itself for specialised institutes, especially in the ethics and compliance fields. Rankings and ratings are also subtle and efficient tools for shaping global governance. All these initiatives are little by little designing and implementing our global governance.[1]"
global leader,"Global leaders are an emerging class of professionals that are adept at operating in international and multicultural contexts. Initial research shows that global leaders are a unique breed with identifiable traits. They have a natural curiosity about the world and interest in people different from themselves. This interest inspires visionary initiatives and organisations that span national boundaries. Furthermore, real global leaders recognise the impact of their actions on surrounding communities and constituencies. They understand that personal prosperity is dependent upon the prosperity of others and that they play a role in transforming not only their companies, but also the societies in which they operate. Evidence indicates global leaders are not just born, but can be made. Global leaders become who they are by cultivating particular ways of looking at the world, thinking about problems and opportunities and acting with integrity in pursuit of solutions. Research shows that global leaders share three common characteristics: they have a global mindset which allows them to connect across boundaries, they are global entrepreneurs driven to create new solutions and seize opportunities, and they are global citizens inspired to contribute to the communities they touch. Example Paul Meyer, co-founder of the mobile health services company Voxiva, offers an example of a global leader. While born in New York, Meyer grew up in California, Tunisia, Egypt, and Washington as he followed his mother who ran World Bank relief programs in 50 countries. After college he worked for Bill Clinton s 1992 presidential campaign and landed a White House job that took him to South Asia, Bangladesh, South Africa, Uganda, and Tunisia. These experiences led him to found a series of organisations, including the first internet service provider in post-conflict Kosovo and initiatives that used information technology to help reunite families separated by war. His focus would eventually shift towards creating profitable technology-based businesses that also addressed pressing human problems. Meyer has received both the MIT Technology Review s Technology Pioneer Award and their Humanitarian of the Year Award. Meyer exhibits all the qualities of today s global leader: internationally experienced with the ability to turn experience into value-creating opportunities that serve both his organisations and the world. [1]"
global leadership,"Global organisations face increased challenges and competition so success demands the best performance that corporate top managers can produce. When these executives work across multiple borders, they can become global leaders. Succeeding globally means developing a global view while using local knowledge to understand particular business challenges in markets around the world. Executives need to understand different business contexts and be able to identify opportunities, leading to better business decisions about global markets. Challenges for global leaders include balancing the benefits of standardisation with the need for local adaptation, managing virtual teams across geographies and time zones, dealing with contradictory thoughts and working through ambiguous situations. Research indicates that global leaders with the skills to deal with complexity and uncertainty can perform well in global environments, but they can only sustain this level of performance if they pay attention to their values. Examples For instance, an Indian-based multinational company hired a Brazilian executive from a French corporation to head their China operation. This global leader had learned to build on his Brazilian habit of developing friendly relationships so that in China he was able to build networks within the firm and with outside stakeholders such as government, customers, and suppliers and so expand the business.  Brazilian culture highly values relationships, as do Indian and Chinese cultures so that the need to emphasise smooth interactions and develop friendly relationships with outside stakeholders - and so on - was familiar. Paying attention to people this way helped him with his superiors and colleagues in India as well, since Brazil, China and India are all relationship-based cultures. He also needed to overcome his original discomfort with risk in order to meet the Indian's expectation of entrepreneurialism and even more so to show his Chinese colleagues that the company was ready to grasp opportunities. [1] Nestl , the Switzerland-based food company hires international management trainees each year and some are expected to become dedicated expatriates, meaning they can change location every few years. Additionally, they have the option to develop their careers locally. Nestl  likes its masters in management degree trainees to have international exposure and an appreciation for local values as most of its brands are adapted for each country. Global brands such as Kit Kat (chocolate biscuit bar) and Nescaf  are localised, for example, the green tea Kit Kat, available in Japan, reflects the Japanese taste for this beverage while Nescaf  coffee has a localised taste in different countries. [2] View Outlook: less bleak "
global macro,"Global macro, a hedge fund strategy that aims to profit from large economic and political changes in various countries by specialising in bets on interest rates, sovereign bonds and currencies. [1] Unexpected macro-economic news, central bank actions, trading activity, political risk and information asymmetry are but some of the ways in which securities can be temporarily driven above or below their long-term values and expectations. Global macro is an investment strategy which attempts to exploit these temporary deviations from such values and expectations. It does so by taking long and short positions in global equity, bond, commodity and currency markets, both in the underlying cash as well as in the derivatives markets depending on whether a particular segment is undervalued or overvalued.  Investment managers, including hedge funds, who undertake global macro strategies, tend to use both quantitative analysis and qualitative evaluations to understand global relative price movements, liquidity, volatility, business cycles and other macro-economic conditions, so as to profit from them. Also, there exists a band of global macro managers known as proprietary traders, who work in investment banks, albeit these are a dying breed in the US due to the  Volcker Rule . This rule is part of the US financial reform law passed in 2010 to limit short-term, high risk and sometimes highly-leveraged trading activity conducted by banks. Example  There are many global macro managers that exist in the financial world today. The more well-known ones are hedge funds, such as Moore Capital, Bridgewater Associates, Tudor Investment and Brevan Howard. They trade across geographies and asset classes, putting billions of their clients  and their own money at risk in the pursuit of investment profit.

global manager,"A global manager is characterised by the nature of the work he or she does, typically within an organisation with global operations. He or she has the capability to manage amid the complexity of business that is conducted across divergent cultures and time zones. A global manager can also be an expatriate, living and working abroad, but this is not always the case. Global managers can more specifically be seen in terms of three prototypical roles in a global organisation. These are: 1) the global business or product-division managers who are tasked with global strategic positioning and asset co-ordination across the organisation 2) the country managers who bridge between the local market operations and global business objectives of the organization 3) the worldwide functional managers who help leverage knowledge and innovations across the key functional departments throughout the organization. These three archetypes show that the knowledge and experience to carry out global work can be fostered and expressed through an integrated network of specialised global talent. In this way, we see that global experience is not tethered exclusively to the event of expatriation but can be done by managers (whether at home or abroad) through their globally-focused activities and responsibilities. Example Global managers possess a certain perspective among the workforce, which uniquely focuses them to operate in a globalised environment of diverse markets and cultures. They need to manage information and resources from all parts of the world at once, not only individual countries or regions, and integrate this for the development and diffusion of innovation on a global scale. Today's global managers may be developed within traditional corporate career paths. However, we are increasingly seeing employees starting out as global managers as well. This is often the case with firms that are  born global , such as companies whose local markets are too small and so must operate immediately in a global context. [1]"
global market,"The activity of buying or selling goods and services in all the countries of the world, or the value of the goods and services sold. [1] "
global marketing,Marketing activities designed to cover the world as a whole. [1] 
global mindset,"We would define global mindset as one that combines an openness to and awareness of diversity across cultures and markets with a propensity and ability to see common patterns across countries and markets. In a company with a global mindset, people view cultural and geographic diversity as opportunities to exploit and are prepared to adopt successful practices and good ideas wherever they come from. The twin forces of ideological change and technology revolution are making globalisation one of the most important issues facing companies today.  As such, cultivating a global mindset is a prerequisite to becoming a global company.  Companies exhibiting global mindsets include GE, P&E;, Nestle, Unilever, and Colgate. [1]"
global multinational enterprises,"Global multinational enterprises (MNEs) are companies that operate on a global scale, as opposed to MNEs that are regionally focused. There are various definitions of what constitutes a truly  global  company, but one way to interpret this is a company that has at least 20% of its sales in each of at least three different continental markets. So, a company where 70% of their sales are generated in Asia would not be considered a global MNE even though they might have significant operations in more than one country, but one where 30% of sales are from each of Asia, Africa and Europe would be considered a global MNE. ExampleCompanies who are MNEs such as McKinsey, Unilever and Wipro generate sales and profits in multiple locations across the world. [1]"

global virtual teams,"Traditionally, team-based projects required all members to be physically present in a specific location for a set period of time.  Global virtual teams embraces the concept that team members can engage in and deliver projects with limited or no direct physical interaction with other members, allowing multinational enterprises to draw on the widest talent pool available among their global employee base. Teams typically never meet face-to-face, and conduct all project work using VOIP technology and other virtual meeting applications, such as SharePoint. ExampleTake for example, a multinational engineering firm seeking to develop a product, and assigns the relevant internationally located employees to complete the task as a global virtual team. The senior project manager is located in the firm s London office,  the project manager is  in Shanghai and the project leader is located in Boston. [1]"

global work,"Global work can be described as conducting business that requires frequently crossing multiple cultural, spatial and temporal boundaries either physically (through travel and/or relocation) or virtually (via technology). One of the main components of working globally, which differentiates it from  domestic-focused  work, entails traveling internationally on a periodic basis to work with others in another country.  Beyond that, the nature of the work performed involves multi-country or worldwide responsibilities and has implications for the organisation on a global scale. This moves away from viewing global work from the perspective of where it is performed (usually taking place abroad) to what is being performed and how it is focused globally (as opposed to domestically). Broadly speaking, global work can be performed with the employee living and working abroad or remaining located domestically. Forms of global work include: 1) long-term ( expat ) international assignments of 2 to 5 years 2) short-term international assignments of 1 year abroad or less 3) commuter assignments requiring 2-3 week stays in another country punctuated by shuttling back and forth to home 4) discrete episodes of frequent international business travel ( flexpatriates ) 5) global virtual work using information and communication technologies. Example Part of understanding how much travel really needs to be performed in global work is asking when and how it can be replaced by another means, such as virtual work via technology. The use of technology can allow global work to be done in several places across multiple time frames, proving integral to the ability to meet global work demands. Many firms are enabling their global managers to use communication tools such as Skype and collaboration technology like WebEx to virtually conduct global work. This can help bridge communication across large distances when international travel is costly or time-consuming. Pame[1]"
globalisation,"This is the integration of economies, industries, markets, cultures and policy-making around the world. [1] Globalisation describes a process by which national and regional economies, societies, and cultures have become integrated through the global network of trade, communication, immigration and transportation.In the more recent past, globalisation was often primarily focused on the economic side of the world, such as trade, foreign direct investment and international capital flows, more recently the term has been expanded to include a broader range of areas and activities such as culture, media, technology, socio-cultural, political, and even biological factors, e.g. climate change.After the fall of the Berlin Wall, some talked about the rise of a  one world way  of doing business and living, but more recent events have suggested that those thoughts were misplaced as we see the success of a number of varying economic and national systems. ExampleGlobal trade has grown enormously since WWII, international trade in manufactured goods alone has grown an estimated 100 times from $95 billion to $12 trillion in the 50 years since 1955.  However, globalisation is much more than just trade.In the last twenty years the breadth and depth of links between nations and between regions has grown enormously.  Communications costs have declined dramatically allowing easy daily contact via the web and telephone, enabling the outsourcing of IT and other services, to India for example, and the rise in global work teams.Other critical links are immigration and transportation, particularly airlines.  The International Organisation for Migration estimates that there are two hundred million migrants around the world today, they have largely immigrated from the emerging to the developed countries, particularly to  the U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K. and Continental Europe.  Though there are tensions at times in Europe and elsewhere this immigration has changed the face of these regions and increased the personal links across borders very considerably.Finally the transportation of people and goods has increased very substantially in the last few decades with great growth on the number of flights across borders.  During the 80s and 90s growth rates in the number of airlines seats offered of 5% a year were not uncommon, in 2010 there are over 2.3 million flights per month. With this great growth in flights, this has allowed stronger business and personal links.  Today we see a world much more interlinked than in the past. [2]"

A going concern opinion is an unqualified audit opinion with required explanatory language, where the explanatory language pertains to the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.  Auditors should issue a  going concern opinion  when the entity s financial condition is such that there is doubt as to the firm s ability to continue as a going concern.  Although auditors are supposed to issue these when doubt about continuing as a going concern exists, some investors believe auditors do not issue such reports with sufficient frequency to alert the market that a company might fail. The Financial Accounting Standards Board on June 26, 2013 issued an exposure draft that would mandate that the assessment of a firm s ability to continue as a going concern reside with management as part of US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States).[1]   going concern opinion in the news In June 2013 a report on the ambitions of Fastjet, which was aiming to become the first pan-African budget airline, mentioned that its auditor, KPMG, had expressed doubts about the company's ability to continue as a going concern."

gold fix or fixing,"The London gold fix takes place twice a day and provides market users with the opportunity to buy and sell gold at a single quoted price. The first fixing took place on September 12 1919 which produced a price between the original five members: NM Rothschild & Sons, Mocatta & Goldsmid, Samuel Montagu & Co, Pixley & Abell and Sharps and Wilkins. The members today are Barclays, HSBC, Scotiabank and Soci t  G n rale. The four members convene by teleconference at 10.30am and 3pm London time. Immediately prior to the fixing the Chairman uses the prevailing US dollar spot price for London gold and futures prices to determine an opening price in the fixing process. Each of the four members then declares customer buying and selling interest which allows the banks to test market demand and supply. The price is then fixed to balance demand and supply. The price is fixed in US dollars for one troy ounce of gold. The gold fix has been under scrutiny in recent years after numerous critics, including two academics, claimed that it was open to manipulation. Detractors have also complained of a lack of transparency.   Gold fix in the news The Financial Conduct Authority fined Barclays  26,033,500 on 23 May 2014 for failing to adequately managed conflicts of interest between itself and its customers as well as systems and control failings in relation to the gold fixing. In June 2014 it was reported that the World Gold Council would hold an industry forum to explore reform of the London Gold Fix.

"golden, tin and silver parachutes","A  golden parachute  is the term used for the special compensation arrangements, for example, cash, a special bonus, stock options or vesting of previously awarded compensation, between a company and its senior executives in case the company is acquired or if an individual is fired or made redundant. Sometimes any acquisition will trigger the golden parachute, but in other cases it is only activated when the deal is hostile.  Often the golden parachute is exercisable only if the manager is dismissed, sometimes as a result of the merger or acquisition. Usually, the golden parachute award will be significant in comparison to the executive s normal compensation.  Silver parachutes refer to similar awards granted to lower level executives and even senior managers.  Tin parachutes refer to similar awards that are granted to all employees below the executive level. ExampleOne of the most famous golden parachutes was received by Stan O Neal, the chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch at the time of the financial crisis of late 2007.  When he was ousted in October of that year, he received a severance payment of approximately $160 million. Another chief executive's golden parachute was received by Frank Newman in 1999 after his company, Bankers Trust, was acquired by Deutsche Bank.  In this instance, it was reported that he received $100 million and that the Bankers Trust's chief financial officer, Richard Daniels, received $25 million.Following an unsuccessful attempt in 1998 by The Bank of New York to purchase Mellon Bank, one of the defences erected by Mellon Financial to fend off another hostile purchaser was the creation of golden, silver and tin parachutes for all Mellon employees. Depending on their level, each senior manager could receive two or three times their base salary plus a bonus. The tin parachute for all of the other employees specified that anyone made redundant within three years of a change of control - merger or acquisition -would receive one year s salary plus two weeks for each year s service up to 52 weeks. The Mellon equity plans also provided special vesting in the case of a change of control.  These became significant issues for Mellon s 17,000 employees when the bank agreed to a friendly merger with The Bank of New York in 2006. [1]"

Example  For returns on local-currency-denominated government bonds across a variety of countries, a prominent returns index is JPMorgan s Government Bond Index (GBI). The main GBI is for advanced economies; it consists of the local currency sovereign bonds of 23 developed countries. There are also indexes for emerging markets (EM); the GBI-EM has local currency bonds for 13 emerging markets, whereas the GBI-EM Broad contains bonds for 16 emerging markets. Returns indices aid both investors and researchers. Investors are provided with a benchmark, enabling the analysis of past returns. Researchers are also consumers of index data. For example, a recent paper,  Investing in Local Currency Bond Markets,  (NBER Working Paper  16249, August 2010), depicted the returns available to US investors from holding the sovereign bonds of various countries and showed that the returns on a relatively new asset class - emerging market countries' local-currency-denominated sovereign bonds - were quite attractive. Such a study would be difficult without an off-the-shelf index such as the GBI. [1]"

The concerns stemmed from patent analysis. At the end of 2012, CambridgeIP, a UK-based technology strategy company, found that there had been 2,204 graphene patent pubications from China, 1,754 from the US, 1,160 from South Korea and only 54 from the UK.

green technology,"Also known as clean technology, this refers to the use of technology that makes products and processes more environmentally friendly, for example, by reducing CO2 emissions or by making products more biodegradeable. Overall, green technology aims at contributing to environmental sustainability. Example Exemplary subject areas of green technology are green chemistry, green IT and green housing. As part of a research project in the UK, BASF (chemical company) builds zero-emission houses using green technologies such as solar panels, innovative insulation and ground-air heat exchangers. [1] Green technology can be defined as an umbrella term encompassing the investment asset class, technology and business sectors which include clean energy and environmental, sustainable or green products/ services.  It often includes activities such as water purification, eco-efficient production techniques and renewable energy. Green technology helps to reduce adverse effects on the environment as well as improving productivity, efficiency and operational performance of the technology itself.The term should be differentiated from cleantech, although often used interchangeably, since cleantech generally refers to the emerging financial industry.  Example The ecomagination initiative from General Electric (GE) was launched in 2005. The aim of the programme is to bring forward the development of green technologies. Through this initiative the company is investing in solutions to environmental challenges such as solar energy, hybrid locomotives, lower-emission aircraft engines, lighter and stronger durable materials, efficient lighting, and water purification technology. In the first five years, GE invested $5 billion in clean technology research and development and generated $70 billion in ecomagination revenues.  The ecomagination product portfolio contained more than 90 products in 2009. Since 2005, GE has financed and invested in 247 megawatts of solar projects.

grey swan,"The term ""grey swan"" is derived from the term black swan which was the term given by Nassim Nicholas Taleb to extremely unlikely, unforeseen risk events with a major impact. However, the slew of bad news in markets since the financial crisis suggests unexpected events with a major impact are happening increasingly frequently. This has led some analysts to start using the term grey swan to describe events that, potentially, are as catastrophic as black swan events but that are likely to happen more frequently.   grey swan in the news Among the first to use the term grey swan were the risk team at PwC who put out a paper called: Black swans turn grey: The transformation of risk in January 2012.  In June 2013, FastFT commented on a WPP trading update which mentioned the ""grey swans"" of the Eurozone crisis, the Middle East and dealing with the US deficit.  In December 2012, Bill Gross, founder and co-chief investment officer for Pimco, writing for the Financial Times, discussed white swans, black swans and grey swans. "" Investors in risk markets under the assumption of minimal price risk should be wary of historical white swan investments with 'grey' swan potential,"" he wrote. In October 2012, WPP, the advertising group, cut its sales growth forecasts. Referring to  four grey swans    factors that were not as unpredictable as a  black swan  event   Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive, cited the US deficit, the eurozone crisis, political concerns in the Middle East, and the slowdown in China."

Nominal GDP or GNP is calculated at market prices. For a more accurate indication of economic growth, the impact of inflation or deflation can be removed to produce (inflation-adjusted) real GDP or GNP (also called at constant prices). This is done by applying a price deflator to nominal GDP/GNP. The deflator reflects changes in the prices of all the goods and services in the GDP/GNP, as opposed to other inflation indicators, such as the consumer price index (CPI), which look at a basket of goods. Nominal GDP and GNP are normally calculated on a factor cost basis (at market prices equivalent to the cost of the factors of production). But the value of output can also be estimated by looking at the national income earned from the production of goods and services. Some countries monitor GNI (gross national income) as the key indicator of economic growth."

hard labour,"The term ""hard labour"" can be used to describe the pressures experienced by parents in dual earner relationships, who are combining paid work with the rearing of infant children. The idea of hard labour encompasses the physical and emotional work involved in looking after babies and pre-school children when both partners are pursuing careers and balancing sleepless nights and the needs of very young children with their paid work. Over the years research has shown that women, while often deeply committed to motherhood, may also be highly work-orientated   often more so than previously supposed. In attempting to do the best for their children, at the same time as working to a high standard, many employed mothers feel conflicted. This is exacerbated for the majority of mothers in heterosexual relationships who also find themselves carrying the lion s share of housework   the laundry, cleaning and so on.  Fathers, on the other hand, may be more child-oriented than most employers imagine. While they may be highly work-oriented, fathers are becoming increasingly engaged with children s lives (though not necessarily with housework) and might wish to work flexibly. Yet even today, despite flexible working policies supposedly aimed at ""parents"", fathers often find that line-managers assume that such policies are available only to women. Parental desire to engage with children and progress careers in these circumstances may be stressful   hence the term ""hard labour"" to describe the pressures of combining paid work with child-rearing in the infant years.[1]    hard labour in the news In the Financial Times MBA blog  Parenthood and the MBA, (July 25 2011), Abhishek Ramanathan considers the trials of combining parenthood with study and observes the pressures of trying to do both the role of parent and business administration student to a high standard."

hard money,"The term hard money is broadly used to describe money, or financing, which is backed by collateral, or financing terms, that people trust. It is therefore used in a number of different settings. Historically, governments were said to have been pursuing a hard money policy when their currencies were backed by bullion, such as gold. These days, hard money advocates at government level would like to see budget surpluses and a currency backed by reserves of liquid tradable securities.  Hard money is also sometimes used instead of the term hard currency and is used to describe a globally traded currency that can serve as a reliable and stable store of value. In the US, the hard money is also used to describe certain loans in the real estate industry. Hard money loans are extended to a borrower who secures the loan by offering real estate assets as collateral. Hard money is also sometimes used to describe regulated US political campaign donations that can be used to fund campaigns that make direct pleas for votes. Soft money, in contrast in this context, describes money donated for party building or educational purposes.   hard money in the news In April 2013, the FT published an analysis of a book called: The Great Deformation: the Corruption of Capitalism in America by David Stockman which looked at hard money policy (or the lack of it in recent years in developed countries). The reviewer commented that over the years, Mr Stockman's concerns about governmental debt had grown to encompass all forms of debt. ""His new book,"" the reviewer said, ""is really an extended screed against corporate, financial, housing and personal debt."" ""In this respect, Mr Stockman has aligned himself with monetary cranks who have long denounced 'fiat money' and demanded the return to a rigid gold standard. Indeed, his publisher distributed a blurb from one of the crankiest monetary cranks in America, Lew Rockwell of the Alabama-based Mises Institute, named after the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, whom all hard-money people worship."""

health exchange HIX health insurance exchange,"Health insurance exchanges were launched in the US in October 2013 as part of a radical overhaul of the American health system brought in by President Barack Obama under Obamacare. Health insurance exchanges are online marketplaces for purchasing health insurance. They are aimed at low to middle income Americans who were previously unable to afford health insurance cover, although anyone is permitted to use them, The exchanges allow potential customers to compare insurance policies on levels of cover and price. They were expected to result in lower premiums for most users and vastly lower premiums for others. At launch on October 1 2013, premiums for lower level coverage were capped at 9.5% of income for those earning between 300 per cent and 400 per cent of the Federal Poverty Line. There is a sliding scale so those earning less would pay less. Unlike in the open insurance marketplace, no insurance policy on the health insurance exchanges can refuse someone coverage for a pre-existing medical condition. The new policies were due to become effective in January 2014. Before the launch of the scheme some experts estimated that Americans with health coverage would expect to pay about 20 per cent of their income on health insurance.   health insurance exchange in the news Nearly 3m Americans were reported to have visited the new health exchanges on the first day of business.

hidden needs,"Also known as latent needs, these are issues and problems that customers face but have not yet realised. When hidden needs are addressed by product or service design, customers are both surprised and delighted. Traditional methods of market research using focus groups and surveys are ineffective for identifying hidden needs, as customers often struggle to articulate their deeper needs. Qualitative methods such as repertory grid technique (from psychology) and ethnographic market research (based on ideas from anthropology) can be used to uncover customers  hidden needs.  Example Companies that are successful at identifying customers  hidden needs are able to develop breakthrough products or services. Such products have unique features that excite customers because they solve issues or problems that customers face. For example Fuji, the Japanese electronics company, was the first to develop a travel adapter that combined all of the connectors needed to fit any power outlet worldwide, all in one unit. Previously, business people had been forced to carry a selection of separate adapters, which were bulky and easily lost. The new Fuji product cleverly combined all of the different adapters in a slide-out unit, which even incorporates a USB connector. Other companies that have used the identification of customers  hidden needs to drive breakthrough innovation include Bosch, the maker of pharmaceutical production equipment, and Whirlpool, the appliance manufacturer of various products such as washing machines.

high street,The main street of a town where many shops and businesses are. [1] 
high technology,The use of the most modern technical knowledge and methods. [1] 
high water mark,"A high water mark is used in investment funds to ensure that investors do not have to pay performance fees for bad or mediocre performance. High water marks have been particularly important for investors in hedge funds which have traditionally operated on a steep ""2 and 20"" fee structure (which means they charge 2 per cent of assets invested and 20 per cent of any appreciation in value of the funds). A high water mark ensures that if the net asset value of the fund falls in one investment period (a month, a quarter, a year   whichever is defined in the funds prospectus) that the performance fee can only ever be charged on any outperformance above the highest the fund had ever reached in a previous investment period. So if the fund falls 50 per cent to, say, $1,500 from a high of $3,000 in one investment period and rises 100 per cent to $3,000 in the next that no performance fee is charged.   high water mark in the news In February 2014 a report looked at the return to the good old days for hedge funds which were said to be more focused on returns again and less interested in managing risk. One hedge fund was reported to be charging a 1.5 per cent management fee and a 20 per cent performance fee with a high water mark, but the manager said a large investor migh persuade him to waive some of the management fee."

high-frequency traders,"High frequency traders (HFTs) use computers to implement various highly active trading strategies to trade at exchanges where automated electronic systems arrange trades.  Electronic dealers are the most common HFTs.  They post standing limit orders to buy or sell securities or contracts and wait for others to trade with them.  After they trade, HFTs generally try to immediately trade on the other side of the market to divest themselves of their positions.  They hope to profit by buying low and quickly selling high.  Sometimes they can trade out of their positions by posting standing limit orders and waiting for other traders to trade with them.  When this happens, they often profit. But if they believe that the market will move against them, they may be unwilling to wait to trade.  Instead, they will actively trade out of their positions by submitting market orders or marketable limit orders.  In these cases, they often lose.  HFTs frequently adjust their orders to respond to changing market conditions.  These adjustments may occur several times a second. HFTs use extremely fast computer systems to implement their trading strategies.  The time between when an event (generally a trade or quote change) takes place on an exchange and when a HFT is able to respond to that event is often less than one millisecond.  During this period, electronic systems will disseminate information about the event. The HFT s computer will analyse the information, choose a response and submit instructions to the exchange. The electronic systems will route those instructions to the exchange. ExampleHFTs must respond to new information quickly to trade profitably.  Speed helps them in three ways: First, they try to be the first to place an order at an attractive price because the first trader in is the first trader out. Second, they must quickly cancel their orders to prevent trades that they are no longer willing to do. Finally, when they want to actively trade with a standing order, they must arrange the trade before other traders can and before the order is cancelled.  To trade quickly, HFTs use very fast computers with highly optimised code.  They also co-locate those systems next to exchange computers to minimise communication time lost to sending messages at the speed of light and lost to passing messages through routing switches. [1]"
high-frequency trading - HFT,"High-frequency trading (HFT) is high-volume trading used by proprietary traders and a new breed of electronic trading outfits (typically privately held). It relies on synthesising information faster than other traders using sophisticated trading algorithms and powerful computers, often co-located near the electronic matching systems within securities exchanges.  By co-locating their trading systems close to the exchanges  matching 'engines', these firms can speed up their orders to the exchanges ever so slightly (the time savings are in the milliseconds) and thus provide a competitive advantage over other traders whose systems are not as fast. In addition, the HFT firms' orders are designed to be not only faster but also potentially more nimble by strategically and swiftly placing buy and sell orders (and, in many cases, quickly canceling them).  In this way, HFT firms can detect or anticipate changes in the depth and direction of order flow from institutional and retail investors. For example, the HFT traders can position themselves to profit from momentary order imbalances and fleeting intra-day price trends by placing aggressive buy and sell orders (thus putting them first in line to gain by either first buying low and selling slightly higher in less than second or by first selling high and then buying moments later at a slightly lower price). Example One example of an order that can help an HFT trader identify these short-term fluctuations in liquidity and price trends is a flash order.  Flash orders are typically sent to certain traders in a market for less than one second before being routed more widely. Their speed of execution can save the trader placing the order some money, if only a sliver of a basis point, while also providing HFT firms with a potential profit opportunity.[1] View Lex: High-frequency trading"

hockey stick,"This refers to the shape of a graph where one variable rises steadily over a period of time and then dramatically increases towards the end of the period.  The shape resembles an ice hockey stick blade. [1] ExampleA  hockey stick  graph showing much higher global temperatures in the last few decades, than over the previous millennium, was used as a key piece of evidence in climate change science to represent the recent rise in global temperatures. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change nicknamed the graph  hockey stick , which shows a spike in temperatures in the past century. The graph was slammed as  exaggerated  by one of the UK s leading statistician, Professor David Hand, in a vindication of claims that global warming sceptics have been making for years. Prof Hand from the Royal Statistical Society, said that the graph has had been compiled using  inappropriate  methods. The graph was a key part of the ""climategate"" email scandal.  E-mails were hacked in the autumn of 2009 from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (UEA). They caused a storm, as they appeared to show scientists manipulating and concealing data. In the e-mails, UEA s Professor Phil Jones referred to a  trick  to  hide the decline  in temperatures suggested by certain sources of data. A similar trick was alleged by climate sceptics to have been used in the hockey stick graph. The UEA scientists said that  trick  merely referred to a scientific technique. Prof Hand said his criticisms should not be seen as invalidating climate science. He pointed out that although the hockey stick graph   which dates from a study led by US climate scientist Michael Mann in 1998   exaggerates some effects, the underlying data show a clear warming signal. A report commissioned by UEA with advice from the Royal Society, the UK s prestigious national science academy   exonerated UEA s unit s scientists, it criticised climate experts for failures in handling statistics.  It is very surprising that research in an area that depends so heavily on statistical methods has not been carried out in close collaboration with professional statisticians,  the report concluded.

house price index,"A measure of the prices at which dwellings are bought and sold over time. Indices can encompass different areas, for example a city, state, region or country. Growth rates of house price indices measure house price inflation. Transactions fluctuate over the year, so that seasonal adjustment is important. In addition, housing is a varied commodity in terms of building quality and location, so the accuracy of house price indices depends on quality-adjustment. Few countries  house price indices are estimated in the same way, which can create problems for comparisons of house price inflation between them. Example Some indices cover only narrow market segments. For example, house price measures for many central and eastern European countries refer to only new dwellings in a selection of cities and their price behaviour differs from those for existing homes. Australia measures only prices for major cities and Japan has no house price data at all. Indices may use data from different sources - sales listings, mortgages, legal paperwork, or formal registration of title   that contain different pieces of information gathered at distinct points in time. When making cross-country comparisons, it is wise to check sources and to look at the general directions of change rather than to expect that detailed differences mean much. Eurostat and member governments have been for some time trying to harmonise house price data for the whole of the European Union, but it is now only beginning to publish (incomplete) indices.

housing rent index,"A measure of the level of rents for dwellings in a geographic area over time. Like house price indices, they are more accurate when they are quality-adjusted and encompass large, representative samples. Good quality rent indices are rare, because generally far less effort is put into calibrating them than house price ones. Rents for properties on the market may differ significantly from those for existing tenancies because of such factors as rent-adjustment lags, long versus short-term tenancies and rent regulations. Rent measures used in consumer price indices are further influenced by the existence of  affordable , below-market rent properties and social housing, particularly in Europe. Comparisons of rents and house price indices may easily to lead to wrong conclusions, because house prices refer to recently traded properties; whereas rent indices may refer to a mishmash of market, regulated and social rents.

housing supply responsiveness,"Changes in house prices depend on how quickly supply responds to changes in demand. If supply responsiveness is weak, changes in demand will lead mainly to rises and falls in prices. The price elasticity of new supply measures the proportionate increase in new housing supply in relation to the proportionate increase in house prices. Some cities and countries have much poorer long-run supply responsiveness than others and, so, are more prone to house price inflation and fluctuations as a result. Example Sweden and the UK are examples of countries with poor supply responsiveness.  Germany has historically had a much greater supply responsiveness and much more moderate house price rises and low price volatility as consequences. [1]"

human capital,"Human capital refers to the knowledge and skills of an individual.  Putting a monetary value directly on human capital would be an impossible task. However, we commonly measure the value of human capital as the present value of a person s future wage and salary income. For example, if a person were starting a 45-year career with an initial salary of $40,000, and expected his or her salary to grow at an average annual rate of 3%, then using an 8% rate for the time value of money, this person s human capital at the start of his or her career will be $705,224. Higher growth rates or lower time value of money rates will produce higher human capital valuations. It is certainly reasonable to identify the human capital of many new college graduates as being worth more than $1m. As we mature, for most of us our human value will actually initially increase as we acquire more skills and knowledge. However, eventually the reduction in the number of remaining years of work will begin to reduce our human capital value. On the day we retire and give up all future employment, our human value as we normally measure it would become zero. For most people, their human capital is their single most valuable asset. As such, it is extremely important that this asset be protected with such tools as life insurance and disability income insurance. Example The abilities to accurately throw a 60-yard pass, write a computer program, and diagnose patient ailments are all examples of human capital. [1]"
human cloud,"This is a type of workforce where tasks or projects, not jobs, are performed remotely and on-demand by people who are not employees but independent workers. The type of work stems from white-collar jobs - chopped into hundreds of discrete projects or tasks, then scattered into a virtual  cloud  of willing workers who could be anywhere in the world, so long as they have an internet connection. Some of these tasks are as simple as looking up phone numbers on the web, typing data into a spreadsheet or watching a video while a webcam tracks your eye movements. Others are as complex as writing a piece of code or completing a short-term consultancy project.   human cloud in the news Examples of human cloud online platforms include Upwork, Freelancer and People per Hour, which feature skilled tasks such as copywriting, IT and design work. Upwork, formed in 2014 by a merger of two large platforms, is now the behemoth of the human cloud, processing about $1bn worth of payments from employers to workers in 2014 (of which it takes a 10 per cent cut).

hybrid,"The term  hybrid  is often used in relation to entities or financial instruments which are treated differently for tax purposes in different countries. An entity might be transparent in one country, so that its profits accrue directly to the owners for tax purposes, but opaque in another, so that the entity is taxed directly irrespective of the capacity of the owners. An instrument might be treated as a share (or equity) in one country but as debt (or loan capital) in another country. The BEPS project has focused on preventing the loss of tax through tax mismatches."
hybrid bonds,"They are best-known for their use in bank capital since their equity-like features - such as executives' ability to suspend interest payments or delay redeeming the bonds - gave banking regulators the confidence, pre-crisis, to allow them to count towards banks' regulatory capital.  However, in the event most banks proved reluctant to force hybrid bondholders to take the hit and regulators are since reconsidering what they will allow to count towards regulatory capital. A new generation of hybrids, known as contingent convertibles, or Cocos, is currently being developed. The products are designed to convert into equity to boost bank capital if the institution comes under extreme stress, but many traditional hybrid investors are balking at the idea of holding instruments so much more like equity than old-style hybrids. Other sectors, particularly utilities, have also used hybrids as part of efforts to maintain particular credit ratings. Credit ratings agencies consider the bonds as partly equity, meaning they do not add to balance sheet leverage quite as much as regular debt.  As tax authorities consider them debt, the interest payments are usually tax-exempt, unlike regular equity dividends.

hybrid capital,"Hybrid capital is a form of debt that has been substituted for equity.  This type of capital has both debt and equity features.

iceberg order,"An iceberg order is a type of order placed on a public exchange. The total amount of the order is divided into a visible portion, which is reported to other market participants, and a hidden portion, which is not. When the visible part of the order is fulfilled, a new part of the hidden portion of the same size becomes visible. As an example, suppose that a market participant places an order on the London Stock Exchange to buy 1,000 shares of stock AAAA at no more than 120p per share, with a visible portion of 100 shares. Other traders will see a buy order for 100 shares at 120p, with the other 900 remaining 'dark' or hidden. If someone places an order to sell 100 shares at 120, then the visible portion will be fulfilled. A new visible order to buy 100 at 120 will appear on the order book, and an order to buy 800 shares will remain hidden. Iceberg orders are allowed under the Mifid rules, which enforce transparency of securities trading in the European Union, through the 'order management' waiver to pre-trade transparency. This waiver means that orders can be hidden from the market, if this is done to facilitate trading strategies which could be accomplished without hidden orders. In the case of iceberg orders, this means that instead of placing an iceberg order, a market participant could place a normal limit order and replace it by a new order for the same amount each time it is fulfilled. Since there is no difference in what the other market participants would see, the iceberg order simply makes it easier to carry out this strategy automatically, and does not give any unfair advantage. Exchanges decide which among several orders at the same price level should be carried out first by using time priority, or 'first come first served'. In the case of iceberg orders, the visible portion has normal priority but the hidden portion has lower priority than any visible order. This means that an order placed after an iceberg order will execute after the visible portion but before the hidden portion. For exchanges governed by Mifid this system of priorities is a legal requirement. The method of determining priority between the hidden portions of different iceberg orders varies from exchange to exchange. [1]"

ijarah,"A trype of contract in Islamic finance. Islamic financial institutions use ijarah contracts either as a lessor or a lessee.  Some jurists define ijarah as ownership of the right to the benefit of using an asset for a period in return for a consideration. Ijarah is classified into operating ijarah, which doesn t include a promise to transfer the legal title of the leased asset into the lessee at the end of the lease, and ijarah muntahia bittamleek, which is concluded by passing the legal title of the leased asset to the lessee. For the ijarah contract to be valid it must be preceded by acquisition of the asset (or the usufruct of the asset) to be leased by the institution (lessor).  The ijarah contract is a binding contract which neither party may terminate or alter without the other s consent. The duration of the ijarah contract must be specified in the contract and normally commences on the date of executing the contract unless a future date is agreed by both parties.  It is permissible that the Islamic bank requires the lease promissor (customer) to pay to guarantee the customer s commitment to accept a lease on the asset and the subsequent obligations, provided no deduction to be made to this sum except for damages suffered by the bank as a result of the customer s breaching his promise. No rental will be due if the lessor fails to deliver the asset to the lessee on the date specified in the ijarah contract.  At the end of the ijarah agreements the lessee has one of three options; either to return the leased asset to the lessor or to renew the lease contract for another term or to purchase the leased asset for a price that is determined based on rental payments made by the lessee. In the Islamic bank s financial statements, the assets acquired for ijarah shall be recognised at historical costs that include its net purchase price plus other expenditures necessary to bring the asset into its intended use.  Ijarah revenue (when the Islamic bank is a lessor) and expense (when the Islamic bank is a lessee) are recognised when the ijarah instalment becomes due. Normally the lessor will be responsible for major repairs (other than periodic ones; which are borne by the lessee) unless they are the result of the lessee s misuse or misconduct.  The Islamic bank should disclose the accounting policies adopted for operating ijarah and ijara muntahia bittamleek in the notes accompanying the bank s financial statements. [1] [2] [3]"

implied volatility,"An option pricing term that describes the use of the observed market price of a derivative security to infer more fundamental information. This is best understood by recognising that an option contract increases in value as the volatility of the underlying asset increases.  This seems counterintuitive as we typically think of volatility as detrimental. Economists have developed mathematical models to value such options.  The formula produces an estimate of an option s price if the terms of the option (exercise price, time until expiration), relevant market conditions (current price of the underlying asset, interest rates), and an estimate of the volatility are plugged in. Furthermore, if the market price for an option can be observed, we can use the model to work backwards and infer the level of volatility that market participants appear to be plugging into the formula to price the option. This is the implied volatility, a measure of the market s best estimate of the volatility of the price of the underlying asset. It is a useful gauge of the market s perception of risk, and it can experience very large, rapid changes in, for example, a financial crisis or market downturn. Example Suppose two pieces of land are each worth exactly $1m.  Piece A is a vast tract of dozens of square miles of inaccessible land in the interior of Alaska. Piece B is a few hundred square yards just outside the entrance to the Dallas Fort Worth airport. Consider two derivative contracts, each relating to one of these properties. Call Option A allows you to buy the Alaskan tract for $1m at any time in the next five years. Call Option B allows you to buy the Dallas Fort Worth tract for $1 at any time in the next five years. Little is likely to happen to the Alaskan land s value so that you offer only a very small price for Option A.  However, the value of the DFW land can shoot up or crash dramatically depending on the fortunes of the airport.  If the value shoots up within the next five years, you can exercise the option, buy the land for a million dollars, and sell it at a large profit. If the value of the land drops below a million dollars, you do not care whether it drops ten dollars or half a million dollars as you will not exercise your purchase option in either case. Thus, the value of an option benefits from volatility or dispersion: the option holder gains any upside and can walk away from any downside. Therefore, Option B sells for much more than Option A.

The minimum income that can be taken from a drawdown arrangement each year is  0. The maximum income is 120 per cent of a pension calculated according to tables produced by the Government Actuary's Department (GAD). These tables are based on the amount your fund would buy as an annuity based on your life only and with no allowance for any future increase. The maximum income level is recalculated every 5 years.

income investing,"Income investing in its broadest sense refers to any form of investment which can generate a cash income in the form of dividends, interest or capital gains. Income investing can therefore refer to a strategy of buying shares in a company that pays dividends. It can also, when the term is used broadly, encompass investments in bonds or even property. Usually, however, the term is used to refer to equity income investing, and would often encompass the practice of re-investing dividend income.   income investing in the news In January 2013, investors were reported to be pouring cash into UK equity income funds with an estimated  220m flowing into the sector in November 2012 alone, representing the largest inflows in five years. In June 2013 an asset manager warned that too many investors were chasing companies viewed as pure income plays, and that some sectors had reached full valuation."

[1] "
income statement,"An income statement is a report showing how much a company earned over a given period of time (usually over a quarter or a year). An income statement also shows the costs and expenses associated with earning that revenue. The bottom line of the statement shows the company's net earnings or losses at the end of that the period represented. For listed companies, income statements also show earnings per share. This lets investors know how much would be distributed to shareholders if the company decided to distribute all the net earnings for the period, although companies usually decide to reinvest a good portion of their earnings in the business. To gain a full view of a company's activities, investors should also read the balance sheet which shows assets and liabilities and a cash flow statement which provides more information about the cash assets listed on a balance sheet. To view an income statement for a listed company you can click on the hyperlinked company name in a story on the FT website or visit the FT's markets data section.                              income statement in the news In February 2014 a FT Lex note considered various measures for looking at debt ratios at Petrobras. It looked first at Petrobras' income statement and found no worries there: operating profits covered interest payments eight times over in the nine months that ended in September. Then it compared profits to the stock of debt on the balance sheet and found net debt was three times Petrobras' ebitda against a global average of 1.5 times, but nothing to be alarmed about. The real red flag was also revealed in the balance sheet rather than the income statement: during the first nine months of 2013, Petrobras' net debt rose from $72bn to $86bn as investment overshot earnings. "
income stock,Shares that pay high dividends on a consistent basis.
income tax,"This is a tax on the earned and unearned income of individuals and trusts. Income includes earnings from employment, profits from a trade carried on by an individual (either alone or in partnership), income from pensions, and investment income such as interest, dividends and rents. The rates of income tax for 2016/17 are the basic rate (20 percent) on income up to  32,000, the higher rate (40 percent) on income between  32,001 and  150,000 and the additional rate (45 percent) on the excess. Different rates apply to savings and dividend income. Various deductions can be claimed for income tax purposes such as certain losses, subscriptions to professional bodies and donations to charities. There is a cap of  50,000 or, if greater, 25% of income on reliefs which are not otherwise limited, but note that this does not apply to charitable donations. See also personal allowance [1]"

independent board,"An independent board is a corporate board that has a majority of outside directors who are not affiliated with the top executives of the firm and have minimal or no business dealings with the company to avoid potential conflicts of interests. An independent board is expected to provide vigilant oversight over firm executives to mitigate managerial opportunism and promote shareholder value. However, an independent board is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for good governance, because the effectiveness of an independent board can be compromised due to several reasons. For instance, some independent directors might be sitting on a large number of boards. Busy directors are unlikely to provide thoughtful advice to and active oversight over firm executives. In addition, independent directors whose skillset or backgrounds are further from the focal firm s businesses might have limited input on a firm s decision making and consequently, resort to short-term financial measures to assess managerial performance. Often, directors approve managers  initiatives too fast without careful investigation because some of them have personal ties with the firm managers or feel indebted to the CEO who hired them.  As such, in some firms, outside directors merely serve as window dressing and don t have real power. Research has shown that independent directors also need incentives, either in a monetary form (stock ownership) or a non-monetary form (reputation, social status), to contribute their human capital (industry experience) and social capital (business or government connections) to the firm and perform their duty effectively. Example According to Sarbane-Oxley Act 2002, all US public firms and any non-US firms listing on US exchanges must have a majority of  independent  directors. Based on Sarbane-Oxley Act, these are outside directors not affiliated with the company for the past 3 years and have no more than $100,000 in business with the firm. In addition, publicly traded firms should have independent audit, compensation and nominating committees. News Corporation s board has long been criticised for its lack of independence. In addition to Rupert Murdoch s influential leadership within the firm, nine independent outside directors have close ties to the company, which immediately raises public concerns as to whether News Corp s board can effectively perform its oversight duty and discipline the firm s top management, especially after the phone-hacking scandal came to light in July 2011.

index,"An indicator of trends in a market or economy, reflecting changes in various component data (often weighted to account for their relative importance). An index is a portfolio of stocks, chosen according to simple, pre-defined rules, and designed to capture a particular investment style.  It is a performance benchmark, in as much as it represents an achievable return from a largely passive investment strategy. These rules don t add any insight into the merits of the underlying constituents of the index but help in its construction.  Indices have become central to the fund management industry. This is because portfolio managers not only require an appropriate benchmark but clients require it as well. In effect, an index helps deliver an independent rate of return and as a benchmark forms an objective test of the effective implementation of an investment strategy.  The key trade offs any index has to balance are breadth versus how investable it is; rebalancing versus turnover costs; and rules versus sampling value judgements. The first equity index is largely attributed to Charles Dow in 1884, who created the Dow industrial average in 1886.   The FT-Actuaries Share Index was first published in 1962. More recently, the  Capital Asset Pricing Model, the most widely taught asset pricing model, has provided a framework for index constructors.  It took the construction of indexes away from just mathematical calculation and sampling technique to a more scientific level. [1]"

They differ from ETFs which are listed on stock markets and can therefore be traded throughout the trading day. An index tracker is known as a passive investment, because no active decision is made to own more of a particular stock. The decision is made by the movement on the index itself.   index trackers in the news In January 2013, the FT's investment writer considered two passive investment products in order to gain exposure to the US stock market. HSBC's North American index tracker which had a total expense ratio of 0.3 per cent is an open ended investment company. While Vanguard's US Equity Index fund, also an OEIC, carried a TER of 0.2 per cent. Both funds were index trackers, rather than ETFs."

indirect price discrimination,"Pricing strategy that charges different prices relative to costs according to buyer s choice for similar goods or services.  It is designed to elicit higher profit margins from buyers with higher willingness to pay. By using indirect price discrimination, the seller can raise profit.  However, if the discrimination is not precise, the seller might lose some profit as high willingness to pay customers switch to lower end offerings.  Indirect price discrimination requires detailed information about each customer segment s willingness to switch among the products offered.Example For instance, airlines and train companies commonly offer multiple fares with different conditions such as unrestricted times of travel at higher prices than journeys with restricted times.  For airline travel, examples of conditions include no change to the itinerary, no stopovers and must include a Saturday away. The objective is for business travelers to choose unrestricted fares and pay more as they normally have less flexibility, for example, they cannot go home until their work is done.  On the other hand, leisure travelers choose fares with particular times of travel and pay less, as they are on holiday, there is no need for them to rush back to work at a certain time. [1]"

individual savings account ISA,"An individual savings account (ISA) was a savings account on which the return was tax-free, and which did not have to be declared in the investor's tax return. There were two components: (i) cash; and (ii) stocks and shares, and life assurance policies. From 1 July 2014 ISAs were replaced by  New ISAs  (NISAs), with a higher investment limit, which can be invested in either cash or shares. All of it can be in stocks and shares, and life assurance policies, if the investor wishes. The ISA limits are indexed annually in line with the consumer price index. See also Junior ISA. [1]   ISA in the news In the UK Budget 2015 announcement, it was revealed that savers will be able to withdraw money from their cash Isas and replace it within the year without it counting towards their annual subscription limit.  For people keen to access their cash as a utility, this is a good thing. You want to be able to get your hands on it,  said Jason Butler, chartered financial planner at Bloomsbury Wealth. However, following the savings tax cut, fewer people may choose to use cash Isas at all, he adds. Meanwhile, the government will extend the range of Isa-eligible investments this year or next year to include bonds issued by co-operative and community benefit societies, and traded securities in small and medium-sized businesses. Having already announced it will include peer-to-peer lending in Isas, it will also consult on adding equity and loans made through crowdfunding platforms   a fast-growing form of alternative finance. Together with the savings tax break, this is predicted to cost the government  1bn in 2016-17. [2]"

There has been a rise in industrial espionage due to a more competitive environment. There is now increased pressure to gain such information, driven by advances in information technology which have facilitated the development of new techniques by hackers, trojans, crackers, or electronic surveillance systems. In addition, recent years have witnessed the rise in importance of social networks leading to greater reputational risk. All these are factors that lead businesses to take protective measures of their industrial property via counterintelligence and establishing security policies.[1]   industrial espionage in the news In February 2013 Apple said its internal systems were hacked by the same attackers who targeted Facebook and Twitter last month. There were concerns that industrial espionage might be far more widespread than reported. However, MTV earlier the same week staged a fake  hack  on its Twitter account, demonstrating that the accompanying publicity can actually be beneficial, if no customers or data are harmed. Burger King s Twitter account attracted thousands of new followers while it was hijacked. "

inflation,"Inflation is a general increase in prices, normally expressed as the annual rate of growth in the consumer price index (CPI) or retail price index (RPI)   measures of the inflation rate. One can also measure inflation in producer or wholesale price terms. Unless matched by an increase in wages, inflation means a loss of purchasing power for the consumer. It also reduces the value of a country's currency, as more units of currency are needed over time to buy the same goods.   inflation example If you have  1 and inflation is 5%, after a year the pound will be worth  0.95. Inflation has diminished the value of your money. If you saved  1 in an investment with a 4% return, after a year your investment will be worth  1.01. Inflation has eradicated part of your return. Alternatively, if you owe  1, then after a year that pound would be worth  0.95 - the inflation will have cleared part of your debt.  effects of inflation Inflation can cause consumers to become more cautious in their spending, which can damage economic output over time. Banks struggle to adjust their rates in order to compensate for inflation and so lend less. Money becomes worth less, meaning those on fixed incomes can afford less and their standard of living declines. Prices have to keep up with the pace of change and home-produced products struggle to compete with imports. As the currency becomes devalued, consumers hold onto tangible assets, creating scarcity. At the extreme, galloping inflation or hyperinflation occurs - currency devaluation can lead to a nation's economic collapse.  However, a moderate amount of inflation can be the sign of a growing economy. Without it, high unemployment, a liquidity trap and the risk of deflation can result. The key is balance.

inflation targeting,"Inflation targeting is a monetary policy strategy used by central banks for maintaining prices at a certain level or within a specific range.  Using methods such as interest rate changes, this could help guide inflation to a targeted level or range. [1]   This policy is designed to assure price stability. [2]   Initially, it was a radical plan adopted by New Zealand in 1989, although other countries, most notably Germany, had evolved something close to inflation targeting considerably earlier.    The term  inflation targeting  does not have a formal definition and is practised in different ways around the world.   It does have some core elements. There is an explicit inflation target; it is announced to the public; the monetary authorities aim to hit that target at a defined point in the future; there is some leeway for inevitable errors and shocks; and the monetary authority is not told how to hit the target but is accountable to the public for its performance.   Another benefit is transparency. If the monetary authorities have sufficient respect and credibility that people believe the target will be hit, households and companies can plan ahead, negotiating wages on the basis of expecting low and stable inflation. The policy is self-reinforcing: low inflation expectations lead to low inflation, confirming the low expectations and so on.   Countries adopting inflation targets have tended to have lower and more stable inflation after the change than before, and the framework has proved durable.  [3]   Prior to the financial crisis, inflation targeting was widely lauded for helping the UK to sustain more than a decade of stable prices and growth. But after explicit targets for consumer prices failed to prevent the credit bubble and recession that followed, some economists now believe that greater weight should be put on asset prices in determining economic policy.

information ratio,"Measuring the historical performance of investment managers, such as mutual fund and hedge fund managers, has always been a challenge. The lack of performance consistency and repeatability (that is repeating past good performance), track record, and adjustment for risk, are the frequently cited problems.  Nevertheless, academia and the industry have attempted to surmount these problems by coming up with succinct, risk-adjusted measures so as to encapsulate the performance of an investment manager using metrics. One such metric is the information ratio. The risk-adjusted measure is the adjustment of investment performance for the risk taken by the investment manager. Information ratio is usually applied to relative return mutual funds and unit trusts, where the after-fee investment performance is measured as that over and above the long-only fund s index or benchmark return divided by the volatility of that deviation. The after-fee performance is the manager s investment performance net of the fees he/ she charges. Both the Sharpe and information ratios are hence referred to as risk-adjusted performance measures.  A high, positive ratio is desirable, while a negative Sharpe or information ratio fund should generally be avoided. These measures not just inform you of the amount of risk you are taking for the additional investment return delivered, but the skill of the manager based on his/ her track record. Example Let us say a mutual fund has been consistently beating its Russell 1000 Growth Index benchmark by four per cent per annum over the last five years, and the standard deviation (or volatility) of the return difference between the fund and the Russell 1000 Growth Index over that period has been four per cent per annum as well. This implies that the fund had an information ratio of one over the last five years. [1] ViewFund evaluation   "

inheritance tax,"Inheritance tax is charged on the transfer of property passing on death (chargeable transfers) subject to various exemptions and reliefs, notably for certain business and agricultural property. It is also levied on certain gifts made within the seven years before an individual's death (potentially exempt transfers) and gifts made outside the seven year period where the deceased has retained some benefit in the gifted property. In addition, certain transfers (to companies and most trusts) are taxed at the time of transfer (life-time transfers).Inheritance tax is calculated on a cumulative basis. When a chargeable transfer is made, tax is calculated at the rate in force at that date taking into account the cumulative total of chargeable transfers made by the individual in the preceding seven years. Inheritance tax is charged at the rate of 20 percent in respect of lifetime transfers and 40 percent where it arises as a result of death (including tax on potentially exempt transfers). There is a nil rate band, which is the first  325,000 of cumulative chargeable transfers on which no inheritance tax is charged. The nil rate band is expected to be frozen at the current level of  325,000 until 5 April 2018. There is an exemption for most transfers between spouses and civil partners. The unused proportion of the nil rate band on the first death can be transferred to their surviving spouse or civil partner, increasing their nil rate band by that percentage. A reduced rate of inheritance tax is applied where 10 percent or more of a deceased s net estate is donated to charity. See also pre-owned assets. [1]   inheritance tax in the news In the UK Summer Budget 2015 speech, the government announced that the inheritance tax threshold on family homes was lifted to  1m.  The government also announced that from April 2017, inheritance tax will be payable on all residential property owned by non-domiciled residents, regardless of their tax residency, even if the property is held indirectly via an offshore company or partnership. [2]"
inheritance tax and trusts,"A charge to inheritance tax applies to all trusts set up after 21 March 2006, with transitional provisions applying to trusts in existence at that date. Broadly, the charge is 20 per cent of the value of the assets transferred into trust in excess of the nil rate band in force at the time of transfer where the transfer takes place during the settlor s lifetime and 40 per cent of the value where the transfer is on death. In addition there is a tax charge on the value of the assets (at up to six per cent) every ten years, and a further charge of up to six per cent when the assets leave the trust. There are very limited categories of trust to which these charges do not apply, primarily certain life interest trusts for minor children created on death, trusts created for disabled people (whether on death or during life). See also inheritance tax.[1]"

innovation,"Innovation involves producing new products and services, new business models, and new or improved methods for producing goods or services. Innovation is more than invention.  It feeds commercial success, normally boosting efficiency and/or profits. Organisations can innovate in different ways: a manufacturing plant could improve its production efficiency; research and development could develop new technology for a product; the service operations department could find a better way of serving customers; and marketing could define a new business model. Some very successful companies combine these different types of innovation. Example Caterpillar, the US earth-moving equipment manufacturer, is famous for its innovative, well manufactured and robust equipment. However, the organisation s after sales service is also legendary and innovative. The performance of Caterpillar equipment is monitored remotely, so that the company is able to deal with equipment problems before the customer is even aware of such issues. [1]      "
innovation accounting,"Innovation accounting refers to the rigorous process of defining, empirically measuring and communicating the true progress of innovation   such as customer retention and usage patterns - whether for start-up companies, for new products or business units within established companies. The terms innovation and accounting are both well defined and understood. However, by combining the two terms together they take on a very different meaning. When traditional accounting measures are used to measure innovation, it often has the effect of stifling or suffocating the new product or start up company. This is because traditional accounting tends to work best when measuring established products or on-going concerns. By definition, new innovations have a limited operating history and little to no revenue and are burning cash well in excess of revenue.  In this context, financial ratio analysis, cash flow analysis and other standard practices shed an unflattering light on the new innovation, especially in comparison to existing products or businesses within established companies.   why innovation accounting is important It is critical to use the right metrics to understand causes and effects. Using the wrong metrics can be very damaging. Using market buzz, PR hits and product awards are often very superficial approaches. Despite this, many entrepreneurs tend to refer to the number of retweets and Facebook  likes  as legitimate market validation. For example, a network security company focused on the number of resellers contractually signed to resell its new product to indicate validation of its product. In reality, this was a  vanity metric  as there was no financial commitment on the part of the resellers. In another example, a number of early sales were actually false positives because they were sold to users who required many modifications to the original. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to the key metrics. They must be carefully selected and they evolve as the business matures. The metrics must go beyond the obvious and prove objectively that the company is moving towards sustainability. Ultimately, the company will, over time, move from validated assumptions to a quantitative financial model. Examples include metrics that address depth of user engagement. There is a legitimate reason that the  hockey-stick  curve is largely flat at the beginning of a new product or business cycle. It's not because the founders or team leaders are not working hard, but because uncovering a business model that works starts with lots of things that do not and need to be refined.   innovation accounting at work In the 1990s IBM had confronted the harsh reality of missing the opportunity to establish early leadership in many new tech markets from network routers to data communications to the internet. While there were several reasons for this, one important factor is that IBM applied the same rigorous metrics to its new products as it did to its established products, which led them to be discontinued. When Lou Gerstner joined the company as CEO during IBM s darkest days, he recognised that this needed to change and he developed the Emerging Business Opportunity Group (EBO), who was charged with identifying new billion dollar businesses for IBM. One critical change that Mr Gerstner implemented was to alter the way that these new business opportunities were evaluated. He brought in entrepreneurial executives to lead these new ventures and tasked them with eliminating market ambiguity and increasing strategic clarity. Ultimately, the IBM EBO approach resulted in a number of new multi-billion dollar businesses and re-energised and re-established IBM as a major player in the IT space.[1]"

In contrast, in other countries such as the UK, insiders refer to only the people who work inside the company, board members, i.e., executive and non-executive directors, former directors who are no longer board members, and Person Dispensing Managerial Responsibility (PDMR) meaning any non members of the board but employees considered to be party to price sensitive information. These individuals are subject to the same rules and their transactions are reported under the listing rules. There are undoubtedly some cases of insider trading particularly before information is released because the gains from trading on such information may be higher than the potential costs of being caught, particularly since some events lead to a substantial change in the stock price. Thus, one would expect insiders to trade strategically: they will not trade on all insider information, but they may target some specific information to trade on. The issue is whether the authorities have the ability and the means to analyse all the large amounts of trading that is taking place in the market before any price sensitive information is released. ExampleShould trading by outsiders on insider information also be referred to as insider trading, in the same level as trading by people who are literally insiders in the firms  It is already difficult to ascertain that an insider is trading on private information, but it is much more difficult to find out an outsider trading on private information, as the case of Rajat Gupta and Raj Rajaratnam illustrates. In 2012, the jury found that Mr Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs director and head of McKinsey, had provided corporate secrets to Mr Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group founder who was given an 11-year sentence for insider trading in 2011. The Rajaratnam case highlighted the complexities of finding and prosecuting trading on private or insider information.

intangible,Used to describe something that has value but does not exist physically. [1] 
intangible assets,"Assets that have no physical form but are considered valuable resources of the business, e.g. patents, trademarks, goodwill, brand names, licences, franchises, etc. [1] The term  intangible assets  includes items such as patents, mining claims that have no physical properties, a distinctive proprietary emblem, insignia, or a name that identifies a particular product or service. A trademark is an intangible asset that may be protected from use by others. These assets are often difficult to value accurately and their true value may differ significantly from the amounts indicated in the balance sheet. It also includes goodwill which is the value of a business to a purchaser over and above its net asset value. It reflects the value of intangible assets such as reputation, brand name, good customer relations, high employee morale and other factors that improve the company's business. Acquired goodwill is normally given a value in a company's balance sheet.  Although intangibles have no intrinsic value they should not be ignored when calculating net debt to group shareholders  funds on the grounds that they have some worth to a company   either on an on-going situation or even if they were to become bankrupt. However, it is worrying when the intangible asset element, within the balance sheet, exceeds or makes up the majority of its overall assets. [2]"

The International Integrated Reporting Council   which describes itself as a global coalition of regulators, investors, companies, standard setters, the accounting profession and NGOs   is seeking to raise awareness and encourage companies to include non-financial information in their regular reports.  The IIRC aims to improve the quality of information available to investors to enable a more efficient and productive allocation of capital. It aims to ensure that there is more communication of risk factors which could affect a company's value over time. It aims to enhance accountability and promote good stewardship.   integrated reporting in the news In June 2012 an FT report considered the logic behind the movement for integrated reporting. It quoted a business guru as arguing that what gets measured gets managed and said the model for campaigners was the Johannesburg exchange which had required integrated reporting since 2010. Companies listed on that exchange have to provide environmental and social data alongside their financial results."
integration,The combination of two businesses under one management.
integrity,"In business ethics, integrity describes how people live the moral values they say they believe in. For a person to have integrity, they need to know what their moral values are and then strive to model them in their behaviour. In this sense, the antonym of integrity is hypocrisy and to doubt the integrity of another without just cause is cynicism.  The challenge for all of us, especially in business, is that moral values such as fairness, courage and love are easy to claim to have, but difficult to demonstrate. However, integrity is not an absolute and we must be cautious when anyone or any organisation claims to have complete integrity. The reality is that while we may strive to live up to our values and do the right thing, we will sometimes fail. It s what we do next that then sustains our integrity. Admitting our mistakes, saying sorry and making things right are powerful qualities in people and businesses that strive for integrity. One final, but crucial quality of integrity is that it is not the same as compliance with rules. In fact psychologists and philosophers argue that ""integrity has no need of rules"" (Albert Camus). In this sense then, integrity is about understanding and acting within the spirit of the law, not just the letter. [1]"
intellectual capital,The value created by an individual's ideas or the overall expertise of a company's workforce. An intangible asset that can be protected by patent or trademark.
intellectual property,"Intellectual property (IP) refers to inventions, ideas, creations and other products of intellectual capital that can be protected by patents, trademarks and copyright. According to the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), there are two categories of IP:   industrial property which includes patents, trademarks and industrial designs;  copyright which refers to musical, literary and artistic works such as songs and photographs. [1]  ExampleIn early 2012, the US Congress staged a fierce argument over two proposed bills   the Stop Online Piracy Act (Sopa) and the Protect IP Act (Pipa). According to their opponents, the bills sought to turn search engines and media sites into IP police by preventing them doing business with, linking to or providing internet service for websites selling pirated material. [2] The Protect IP Act (Pipa) would have allowed media companies to identify overseas websites that are rife with pirated movies, TV shows and music. The US attorney-general could then serve notice to the site, requesting it stop hosting illegal content. At the same time, a court order could be issued to payment networks, online advertisers and search engines requesting that they stop working with and linking to the site. Because many sites hosting content are based abroad, they fall beyond the reach of US jurisdiction. But by cutting off the payment processors, advertising networks and search engines that support them, sponsors of PIPA argue that the new law will successfully starve such sites of the money and web traffic needed to survive. The House version of the law, known as the Stop Online Piracy Act (Sopa), includes much of the same language and provisions as Pipa, but was originally more far reaching in its efforts to block infringing sites. [3]  Popular websites including Wikipedia chose to stage an online blackout in protest at the proposed anti-piracy legislation. However, both bills have both been shelved, for now, after fierce opposition from Google, Facebook and other internet companies.

intelligence cycle,"Intelligence cycle is the process of knowledge generation by which gathered information is transformed into intelligence and afterward spread to users. There are distinct phases which comprise the cycle, although the principal ones are: direction, collection, processing, and dissemination. In the direction phase the decision of what to monitor is made, the available means are gathered, as well as the plan to obtain, coordinate and control. In the collection phase raw data is gathered. In the processing/analysis phase the information is synthesised into intelligence through evaluation, analysis, integration and interpretation. In the dissemination phase intelligence is distributed to the end users of the organisation. Afterwards, the circuit continues with revisions after feedback from the decision-makers.[1]   A discussion of the importance of the intelligence cycle How to make sense of business and competitive analysis, published in August 2007, provides a discussion of the role of the intelligence cycle and the folly of progressing in business without proper intelligence. Analysis, say authors Babette Bensoussan and Craig Fleisher, is a crucial part of the intelligence cycle."

interdealer broker,"Interdealer brokers sit between investment banks. They help find buyers and sellers of large, usually illiquid blocks of securities at other investment banks or dealers. They might conduct deals on behalf of large corporations, but the corporations generally go through the investment banks first. Interdealer brokers are used when banks want to move large illiquid assets such as interest swaps, commodities or blocks of shares. They are paid a commission for negotiatiing the deal between the buyer and the seller. Many of the deals they arrange are conducted off-exchange.  There are five main global interdealer brokers: ICAP, Tullett Prebon, Tradition, BGC Partners and GFI Group. Many were founded in the 1980s as trading globalised and investors increasingly turned to tailored hedges such as interest rate or currency swaps to offset risk. About 70 per cent of the global business is conducted either in London or New York.   interdealer broker involvement in the Libor scandal Interdealer brokers do not participate in the daily London interbank offered rate-setting process, although some of the products they do trade are based on it. However, their roles as intermediaries make them key conduits in the market for information for other banks. A broker will typically have several screens of data on his desk plus more information coming through on the telephone as well as an internet-based chatroom or instant messaging system from a provider such as Bloomberg or Reuters connecting him to his main customers at the banks. Through these electronic channels flows a stream of news, market sentiment, jokes and industry gossip. It was these messages that formed the backbone of regulators' investigations and criminal charges relating to the alleged manipulation of the Libor rate. interdealer broker in the news The Libor scandal put the spotlight on interdealer brokers. In December 2012 the UK Financial Services Authority alleged that traders in UBS, the investment bank, had been paying interdealer brokers through wash trades   transactions that have no other purpose but to generate fees. In January 2013 it emerged that ICAP, the world's largest interdealer broker had become a focus of the FSA Libor interbank rate-rigging investigation. In September 2013, ICAP agreed to pay  55m to settle Libor claims. In May 2013, a small UK broker called RP Martin also became a focus of global regulatory investigations. Two RP Martin employees were arrested by the UK's serious fraud office in December."

interest rate swap,"An interest rate swap is a contract to exchange fixed payments for floating payments linked to an interest rate, and is generally used to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The over-the-counter derivatives sector is dominated by interest rate swaps which have grown massively in recent years, partly driven by speculators. As of December 2009, there were some $349,276bn of outstanding swaps, according to the Bank of International Settlements. In a swap transaction, investors exchange or  swap  two types of interest payments   one a fixed rate, the other a floating rate   over the lifetime of a deal.  The swap rate is the cost of switching from a floating rate to a fixed rate.  The floating rate is determined by the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate used as a benchmark for floating rate mortgages and loans.  The appeal of swaps is that they help companies, portfolio managers and banks to manage cash flows by fixing interest payments over time. But if markets move in an unexpected way, they can also produce losses. Typically in a swap the  payer  (a bank, say) agrees to pay a fixed rate for the term of the contract; in return the  receiver  (a company, say) pays a floating rate. If rates rise the  payer  profits, getting a floating rate higher than their fixed payments. Conversely, if rates fall the  receiver  benefits, with the fixed payments received higher than the prevailing rate paid out.

Internal activists are 'inside outsiders', in that they have dual allegiances.  They want their organisations to do well, but they also want them to respond to the needs of the times.  Internal activists seek to contribute to systemic change. As well as initiate change themselves, they also, importantly, help mobilise other people s energies.  Often people work through achieving small wins, finding ways to align change with their organisation s espoused goals.  They do not typically want to claim credit for ensuing action.  But some recognition of their role helps their future credibility. Being an internal activist presents choices.  Whether to be overt or to operate below the parapet   When to be outspoken and when more moderated   How to be persistent and not wear out people s patience   When to desist, because now is not the right time   There are important crafts of doing this work that people deliberately develop.   Internal activist have to live with the ambivalence of identifying both with their organisations and external stakeholders. Others may find them to be ambivalent figures, and so treat them with caution or suspicion.  Being an internal activist requires a thoughtful blending of courage, care for self and craft.[1] Example Typical activities for internal activists: connecting up people with interests in corporate responsibility across their organisation to prompt more action; lobbying board members to place environmental sustainability at the heart of strategy; encouraging their organisation to join networks or adopt monitoring practices (such as the Global Reporting Initiative) that help it improve its performance and accountability on environmental sustainability and social justice; bringing information on social trends into the organisation to help people discuss its licence to operate.  "
internal auditor,Company accountant or other employee responsible for ensuring that the company's financial and operational procedures meet regulatory requirements and/or internal standards and objectives.
internal communication,"Communications that occur inside the organisation are all internal communications.  Many companies refer to this as either employee communication or employee relations.  This sub function of corporate communication has become increasingly critical, as corporations have realised the importance of nurturing relationships with employees as a way of retaining and enhancing the best talent.In the past, companies produced elaborate publications aimed at  selling  the company to employees.  Today, internal communications activities are developed online through intranets or in person through town hall meetings with groups of employees.A strong internal communication function can boost morale, help create happier employees who are more productive, and allow management to develop ambassadors of the corporation and its brands.  Through the use of digital and social media, companies have found ways to enhance communications with employees and create a two-way dialog rather than the more traditional top-down communications in which senior management simply tells everyone what to do.ExamplePhilips used a series of computer-based interactions called  jam sessions , basically these are group online meetings, to help employees understand the company s strategy, to develop new product ideas and to help employees interact with senior management. Held over several days and hosted by many senior executives in the organisation, these jam sessions increased the overall effectiveness of the company s internal communications effort and helped the company to develop money making ideas in the marketplace.

An alliance is an inter-firm collaboration over a given economic space and time for the attainment of the participating companies  goals. Alliances are particularly flexible tools   they can include 2, 12, 20 or 200 companies, they can be written for London, Europe or the World, they can be defined in real time or until certain key objectives are met and they are capable of being used for many strategic goals.  They may have unforeseen consequences however and may tie companies in to a particular set of partners, excluding others (such as the Japanese Keirestu system) and they may constrain strategy.  An equity joint venture is a particularly strong type of alliance where ownership links are involved   the typical alliance will not necessarily involve ownership links. In the present global economy  internalisation  as represented by foreign direct investment (FDI) and ownership has receded relative to  externalisation    the use of arm s length contracts, outsourcing and out-tasking. ExampleIt is estimated that more than 25 per cent of the revenues of Fortune 500 companies come from their alliances - General Electric has more than 180 of them.

intrapreneurship,"Intrapreneurship involves creating or discovering new ideas or opportunities for the purpose of creating value, where this activity involves creating a new and self-financing organisation within or under the auspices of an existing company. An intrapreneur is a person who practises intrapreneurship. According to this definition, a corporate manager who starts a new initiative for their company which entails setting up a new distinct business unit and board of directors can be regarded as an intrapreneur. In contrast, a corporate manager who starts a new initiative using pre-existing corporate structures is not an intrapreneur. Nor is a leader of an R&D; unit within an organisation, whose innovations are managed by the organisation. Were this R&D; leader to create a new stand-alone organisation, which performs its own functions and sells its own products   albeit with strong continued links to the parent firm, organisation   it would count as intrapreneurship.ExampleThe VanCity Savings Credit Union is a credit union based in Canada.

It is this skill that allows domain experts such as financial traders, medical doctors, and fire fighters alike to efficiently make critical decisions in their respective professional environments. They do so by making  holistic associations  in the sense that they rely on cognitive shortcuts which match the decision environment with similar, previously experienced situations. Judgments resulting from expert intuition therefore enable managers to react quickly to a critical situation without having to assess every aspect of the decision problem at hand.   an example of intuition in use In order to forecast sales prior to the launch of a new CD, a record label could generate statistical model predictions by looking at historical performance data of similar artists in the same music genre. However, in practice, marketing managers usually adjust such model forecasts by also taking into consideration more qualitative, contextual information such as current trends in the market, media attention, ethical considerations, and so forth. Experienced managers can hence use their intuitive expertise to subjectively extract the signal from the noise- that is, they are able to identify and interpret contextual information shedding further light on the forecasting task.[1]   intuition in the news In June 2013, an expert in the industry was commenting on the likely effect of large amounts of private equity investment in shipping. He said private equity executives were usually  buttoned-down, methodical  people who were very different from shipowners who worked mainly on intuition."

inventory control,"The process of making sure that supplies of materials, goods being produced, and finished goods are managed correctly. [1] "
inventory cycle,"Also termed stock cycle, an inventory cycle is the fluctuation of GDP caused by the accumulation and the selling of stocks/inventories. If production is greater than demand, GDP will rise but companies will also accumulate unsold stocks. This will encourage some to scale back production, cutting GDP even if demand remains constant. An economic cycle is created and normally the inventory cycle amplifies the existing economic cycle as stocks are accumulated in good times and production is reduced in bad times. In the global recession of 2008, demand plunged, leaving companies with significant unsold inventory. They responded by mothballing factories leading to a plunge in industrial production, output and GDP. Once the stock was sold output rose again purely because some production lines were restarted.

[1] A financial institution that deals mainly with corporate customers and specialises in securities markets activities including underwriting, trading, asset management, advisory activities and corporate restructuring such as mergers and acquisitions. What are the main differences between commercial and investment banking  Commercial banking relates to deposit-taking and lending whereas investment banking is predominantly a securities business. Traditionally commercial banking was viewed as relatively less risky than the more volatile investment banking business. Commercial bank performance was very much linked to economic growth and credit demand whereas investment bank performance is strongly influenced by stock market performance. In many regions/ jurisdictions commercial banking and investment banking have been legally separated. For instance, in the US, the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act prohibited commercial banks from carrying out investment banking and insurance business. This legislation was put in place by the US authorities in response to the 1929 Wall Street Crash where excessive bank securities speculation was blamed for the crash and the Great Depression that followed. Similar legislation was put in place in Japan in 1948. This legislation was repealed in 1999 in both countries. Banks in the EU have been allowed to offer commercial and investment banking services without restriction since 1992. Note that many commercial banks do investment banking business although the latter is not considered the main business area. Example Since the 2007-8 banking crisis, few stand-alone investment banks remain. Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, merged with Bank of America (to become Bank of America Merrill Lynch), converted to bank holding companies in 2008 mainly to increase protection and to enable them to extend their deposit taking business. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are the last remaining major Wall Street firms that operate as independent investment banks. Others are now part of major commercial banks, such as Merrill Lynch, and other smaller operators such as Lehman Brothers went bust in the 2008 financial crisis.

investment grade,"Investment grade issue or issuer ratings are all ratings above BBB- or Baa- included. Investment grade issues are considered from 'extremely strong capacity to meet financial commitments  (AAA or Aaa) down to 'adequate capacity to meet financial commitments but more subject to adverse economic conditions  (BBB or Baa). In practice the investment grade status for an issuer or issue is key as many investors are restricted by federal regulations, private contracts including rating triggers or investment guidelines to invest in investment grade instruments.Private contractors use ratings triggers extensively in loan and bond covenants. These triggers are contractual provisions that give counterparties and lenders the right to terminate the credit availability, accelerate credit obligations, or have the borrower post collateral in the event of a rating action, such as when the rating falls below a certain level. Moody s reported that in 2001, ""out of 771 US corporate issuers rated Ba1 or higher, only 12.5% reported no triggers, while the remaining 87.5% reported a total of 2819 rating triggers."" On the demand side, counterparties often require triggers as a kind of security. Lenders may require rating triggers as protection against credit deterioration, asymmetric information problems, and prospective losses, especially in cases where a borrower faces a serious likelihood of bankruptcy or default. The rights given to the creditors usually vary from an increase in the nominal coupon to a put option. There is, however, also a supply-side reason for rating triggers to reduce the cost of debt. Borrowers are willing to include such triggers because, without them, lenders, out of fear of event risk, would demand a higher initial spread on debt contracts,  or may not be willing to lend as much. Hence, issuers that are downgraded below investment grade to speculative grade see their cost of capital increase and their financing options diminish. The extent by which credit ratings from the global rating agencies are embedded in regulations and contracts is such that even investors that are not bound by these may have to react substantially to a downgrade to a speculative grade.

investor protection,"Actions to encourage honest advertising of financial products, and to prevent fraud to make sure that investors do not lose money if their investments default (are not repaid). Source: Longman Business English Dictionary Investor protection is defined by the extent to which the commercial law and its enforcement protect investors from expropriation by company insiders. Investor protection is usually measured by indicators that quantify explicit protections awarded to shareholders and creditors by corporate, bankruptcy, and reorganisation laws, as well as the quality of law enforcement. Examples of such explicit protections are those that impact the shareholders  ability to vote down directors, including whether to allow shareholders to vote by proxy or vote by mail. Allowing shareholders to vote by proxy or by mail decreases the costs for small shareholders to manifest their dissent. There are also provisions that impact the ability of secured creditors to take possession of their collateral in bankruptcy. In many countries there is an automatic stay upon bankruptcy, meaning that creditors cannot repossess their collaterals and reduces creditor protection. Differences in investor protection across countries are substantial and are believed to be responsible for differences in the development of financial markets and ultimately for differences in economic development. ExampleIn April 2002 investor protection in Italy worsened as a result of a decree issued by Berlusconi s government, which downgraded the crime of  false communication by corporate executives  from felony (serious crime) to misdemeanor (minor offence), punishable at most with a pecuniary fine. This reform lowered corporate executives  incentives to tell investors the truth about the state of their companies.

invisible father,"While men may be privileged in the context of paid work (for example receiving often, on average, more pay than women in equivalent roles) they may be invisible in their role as fathers. Research shows that many fathers (both married/co-habiting and post-divorce) need and desire to spend more time with children, and are often directly involved with childcare. There have been significant shifts in social understandings about fathers  roles in relation to families and hands-on childcare. Yet organisations still tend to position men as economic providers first, and as fathers second.  Research on men and work-life balance shows that fathers are often excluded from organisational initiatives offering flexible and family friendly working, due to line managers  assumptions that men neither need, nor desire, to access such opportunities. Research on fathers and employment demonstrates how employed men are treated first and foremost as workers. Therefore in their role as fathers, men often feel invisible. Those men who do insist on prioritising childcare over paid work can face incomprehension, if not direct hostility, from line managers and colleagues. As a result, some men feel the need to be discreet about their responsibilities as fathers: hence they are  invisible  in the paternal role.   invisible father in the news Simon Kuper writing in the FT in December 2010 describes the thirty hours childcare he undertakes each week as a  secret life ."

jihad,"Jihad is often translated as ""holy war"", but that narrow definition is disputed, by many muslims who employ a wider definition. Most muslims use it in its original linguistic context and translate it as ""struggle"". For these muslims Islam is essentially a religion of peace. They emphasise the passages in the Koran that deal with a person's inner struggle (internal or greater jihad) to dedicate him or herself to Allah. They also refer to passages that state that while it is permitted to enter into a struggle, holy war, or jihad with an aggressor, should that aggressor try to make peace then war is forbidden. These peacable muslims say that Islamist terrorists have misunderstood the broad message of the Koran when they carry out attacks on people who they deem to be ""non-believers"". However, in general parlance the term jihad is often used exclusively   particularly outside Islam   to mean holy war, or the concept of violent struggle against oppressive non-believers. This particular ""struggle"" is what appears to motivate radical muslims. Critics of Islam state there are dozens of verses in the Koran which call on the faithful to take up arms against non-believers. The Islamic Supreme Council a non-profit, non-governmental religious organisation dedicated to educating both muslims and non-muslims, stresses that jihad is not a violent concept in itself. Where a holy war is called for, it says there are strict rules that ought to be applied, such as the prohibition of harm to women, children or invalids. Someone who engages in jihad is known as a jihadi.   Jihad in the news In March 2014 an FT writer looked at the increasing influence of social media in persuading young British muslims to go abroad to fight as jihadis in countries such as Syria. In May 2014 in the wake of its kidnapping of 200 schoolgirls, the UN Security Council blacklisted Boko Haram, a Nigerian group which refers to itself as Group of the Sunni People for the Calling and Jihad and whose name translates as ""Western education is forbidden"". Boko Haram is an offshoot of Al Qaeda the terrorist organisation behind the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. In June 2014 concerns were growing about another Jihadist organisation - ISIS, which stands for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant which was making huge territorial gains in Iraq and was also gaining support and territory in Syria.

jugaad innovation,"Jugaad (a word taken from Hindi which captures the meaning of finding a low-cost solution to any problem in an intelligent way) is a new way to think constructively and differently about innovation and strategy. Jugaad innovation has a long-lasting tradition in India but is also widespread in the rest of the so-called Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) and numerous other emerging economies. Jugaad is about extending our developed world understanding of entrepreneurial spirit in the traditional Schumpeterian style (Joseph Schumpeter was the Austrian economist known as the prophet of innovation). Jugaad means thinking in a frugal way and being flexible, which, in turn, requires the innovator or entrepreneur to adapt quickly to often unforeseen situations and uncertain circumstances in an intelligent way.

The chosen ones are placed in special schools for a gruelling regime of training and absolute obedience to the coach   much like the Soviet system of the cold war era. Once they succeed, they are lauded as the pride of the nation and can win riches that change their families  lives for ever.  The system yielded its first big results four years ago. Between Barcelona in 1992 and Athens in 2004, China averaged 56 medals per games. In Beijing, China topped the medals table with 100 medals, including 51 golds   19 more golds than in Athens. Example After winning her second gold medal, Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen revealed she had been spotted as a seven-year-old at kindergarten, when the size of her hands stood out.

junk bond,"Normally a high-yield bond that is below investment grade in terms of the credit ratings issued by agencies such as Moody's Investors Service or Standard & Poor's. [1] Junk bonds are issued by companies that carry a speculative credit rating. Speculative-grade issuers usually have questionable track records, or have experienced significant events that undermine their ability to pay interest as well as the money back they borrowed. Example:One way of working out the riskiness of a bond is via its credit rating. The idea is that the higher the credit rating given to the bond, the less likely the company is to have problems paying you back. Investors are therefore prepared to accept a lower rate of interest for bonds because the risk that that company will default is much lower. Junk bonds carry a very high risk of default. [2]"

kill switch,"A ""kill switch"" would enable market participants such as exchanges or broker dealers to switch off immediately trading algorithms that are causing instability or erroneous trading in markets. The concept of a kill switch might work in the following way: an exchange could set a limit on the amount and/or value of trades that a particular firm could execute over a certain time limit. If it exceeded those limits, that might trigger a kill switch that would allow the exchange or broker to shut down the trading session.   kill switch in the news The subject was given fresh impetus in August 2012 when Knight Capital Group rolled out new trading software that caused erroneous trading in more than 140 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. It took Knight three quarters of an hour to locate and resolve the problem, and the $460m loss it subsequently recorded for trading out of its positions meant the electronic market maker effectively lost around $10m per minute. A subsequent industry roundtable in the US debated whether kill switches should be introduced. Some worried that applying kill switches could hurt market liquidity and sentiment. Others pointed out that adding another layer of software did not necessarily solve the problem. In Knight's case, the problem was ""old dormant code"" with an undetected error and was triggered by the updated software. It then began generating orders that were unrestricted by volume limits.[1]"

lead users,"Lead users refers to users who are ahead of the majority of the market on a major market trend, and who also have a high incentive to innovate.  Producers seeking user innovations to manufacture try to source innovations from lead users - because these will be most profitable to manufacture.Examples As was said above, many scientists develop instruments to serve their individual special needs.  However, lead users - say, scientists at the leading edge of new and rapidly growing fields such as nanotechnology - will predictably develop the instruments that many other users will want to purchase later.Many semiconductor firms create process equipment to use in their own manufacturing processes. At the same time, the whole field semiconductor production field is steadily moving towards production of chips that are more tightly packed with electronic components.  Firms at the leading edge of that trend are lead users with respect to it, and their innovations will predictably be the ones that other user firms will want.  For this reason, equipment producers are especially avid to copy the user innovations of these leading edge firms. [1]"
lead-left bookrunner,"Lead-left bookrunner is the major bank within a bank syndicate, the group of banks who work together to underwrite a financial transaction, such as an initial public offering or a bond issue. As syndicates have grown to include more banks, the title 'lead-left' is used to indicate the bank that has played the most important role in the transaction, and has been involved in the deal from an early stage.  The term evolved from the position of bank names in deal documentation   the most important bank being named first, in the upper left hand corner of a prospectus. One cannot call a left-lead bookrunner the sole bookrunner if there were other bookrunners on the deal. Even if they were more junior in terms of role.  Defining the roles played within a syndicate is crucial in determining banks' league table positions. League tables are the main ways in which banks measure their performance against each other. Achieving a top ten position in a league table is also seen as an important tool for winning further client business. Left leads have definitely played the most prominent role amongst a syndicate of banks. The term can apply to any type of transaction, be it bonds, equities or loans. ExampleLeague table 'credit' is awarded commensurate with the importance of the role. Credit will be split equally among underwriters that are identified in a deal's prospectus as joint bookrunners or co-bookrunners, for example, while banks identified as 'left lead' receive more league table credit.

leadership constellation,"In the context of professional service firms, concepts such as  leaders  and  followers  are problematic. Traditional hierarchical power structures are replaced by more ambiguous and negotiated relationships amongst professional peers.   Power in a professional service firm comes from controlling access to valuable resources, such as lucrative client relationships, specialist technical expertise, and a high profile external reputation.  Individuals who control these resources can be extremely influential within their firm, regardless of their formal position in the organisational structure.  By contrast, the firm s senior executives (the official  leaders ) may have relatively limited power.   In a partnership, the prevailing form of governance within the established professions such as law and accounting, senior executives are typically elected by their peers to formal positions of leadership and can be deposed if they fail to retain the support of their fellow partners. This practice is also common in corporate professional service firms which often mimic the characteristics of professional partnership governance.   As a result, senior executives in professional service firms can only lead by consensus and need to be acutely aware of the implicit power structures and shifting networks of influence among their colleagues.  Leadership in a professional service firm therefore, is therefore better understood as a process of interaction among organisational members seeking to influence each other rather than as something that an individual does or a quality that an individual possesses.   The term 'leadership constellation' emphasises that leadership is something that happens in the interactions between the key actors in the firm s leadership dynamics.   The potential members of the Leadership Constellation (see image) in a professional service firm are:     Senior executive dyad   this is typically a managing partner and senior partner, or chairman and chief executive     Heads of major businesses   in charge of major fee-earning areas such as specific practices, offices, and market-sector groupings     Heads of business services   responsible for support functions such as Finance and Human Resource Management     Key influencers   may have no formal management role but have power derived from control of key client relationships, valuable expertise, or a strong reputation.    Members of the leadership constellation do not form a leadership team in any explicit sense because the constellation as a whole has no formally defined boundaries or overt identity within the firm   it can overlap with and coexist alongside formal bodies such as the executive committee.   The organising hierarchy within the constellation is opaque, and roles and relationships are negotiated between members on an ad hoc basis.   Individuals within the firm may see themselves as leaders because they have important-sounding titles but may not be part of the leadership constellation because they are not recognised or accepted as leaders by their colleagues. The leadership constellation therefore expresses the informal power structure of the professional service firm. [1]"
leadership in action,"Leadership as an action rather than a role designation. It is the development of leadership practices and behaviours through individual and group reflection with the goal of creating new behaviours and mindsets. Teams often work in environments where they have little power over their fellow team members and holding team members accountable for their actions can be difficult. Individual members must develop and use skills of negotiation, influence, and persuasion to get work done. Individuals, no matter their title or level within an organisation, have opportunities within their teams to exercise leadership and consciously reflect on their actions in real-time. It is the constant consciousness and intent of personal and team learning that leads to perspective change and refines and enhances leadership practices and behaviours. [1] "

In terms of advertising it should mean finding simpler and cheaper ways of communicating what a company wishes to sell.   lean advertising in the news In June 2013 it was reported that a Harvard professor, Thales Teixeira, had found that using online video rather than television advertising had enabled some companies to reach consumers more effectively and at a lower cost. ""Because viewers actively choose online videos, they tend to watch them more attentively than they watch TV ads,"" the Harvard professor is reported to have written. In lean advertising, however, companies should pay close attention to their distributions systems   just posting on YouTube won't do."
lean production,"When things are manufactured using just-in-time production methods, with the aim of zero defects (no faults), no reworking (working again on things that were done wrong) etc. [1] "
leaning against the wind,"Leaning against the wind, or sometimes, leaning into the wind, in economic terms refers to a  countercyclical monetary policy where central banks take action to damp down inflationary booms or to boost growth when the economy is flagging. In June 2005, Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, described leaning against the wind in the following terms: ""The leaning against the wind principle describes a tendency to cautiously raise interest rates even beyond the level necessary to maintain price stability over the short to medium term when a potentially detrimental asset price boom is identified."" ""It should be mentioned that leaning against the wind has the advantage that it can to some degree ameliorate the moral hazard problem of the purely reactive approach to asset price boom-bust cycles. By reacting more symmetrically   i.e. being tighter in booms as well as looser in busts   the central bank would discourage excessive risk-taking and thereby reduce over-investment already during the boom. This in turn would lead to a lower level of indebtedness and less severe consequences of a possible future bust,"" he added.   leaning against the wind in the news In March 2012 a senior economic policy adviser at PwC said that central banks, by continuing to tolerate phases of relatively high inflation were raising questions about their commitment to price stability. Instead, he recommended leaning against the wind of high energy and commodity prices by seeking to influence the exchange rate and expectations of price increases.  In July 2012, an economist said that if the European Central Bank reactivated the securities market programme for bond buying in order to lower Spain's borrowing costs that it would mean it would be ""leaning against the wind"" but with overwhelming force."

lender of last resort,"A central bank's role as the entity that lends money to commercial banks and other financial institutions when they have no other means to raise funds. Source: Financial Times The understanding that the central bank will always stand ready to lend money to a bank or number of banks experiencing a crisis if they cannot obtain finance from market sources.Example The first major bank to get into financial difficulties at the onset of the recent banking crisis, in late 2007, was UK's Northern Rock - the country's ninth largest bank.  Due to a run on the bank, where customers queued to get their deposits, the government had to step in and say that all depositors would be protected by the state. Here the authorities were acting as the lender of last resort. Lender of last resort may lead to moral hazard problems, as there are concerns that some banks that know they will be bailed out may take on huge risks in the belief that they will be protected when things go wrong.

leptokurtosis,"Leptokurtosis or 'fat tailed risk' occurs when the shape of a distribution is more peaked than that of a normal or 'bellcurve' distribution.In such a distribution, small changes are less frequent than in a normal distribution, but extreme events such as large price moves are more likely to happen and are potentially much larger than in a normal distribution. The central peak is narrower, but the tails are significantly longer and fatter.   [1]The bell curve has  thin tails  in the sense that large events are considered possible but far too rare to be consequential. But many fundamental quantities follow distributions that have  fat tails    namely, a higher probability of extreme values that can have a significant impact on the total. [2]Many financial models assumed share price movements were random and therefore had a normal distribution. This turns out not to have been correct, so the models underestimated how likely catastrophic events were. [3]    ViewManaging in a downturn: Focus on the exceptionsBig Freeze part 1: How it began"

level playing field,"An expression for a market or industry in which all participants compete under the same conditions from regulatory and fiscal points of view.  Ensuring a level playing field  is now a common expression in all international agreements, reports, policy statements, proposals and so on.  We suppose that the  level playing field  concept was born somewhere in the offices of the OECD or the World Bank thirty or forty years ago and it has become a seemingly indispensable and unavoidable multilateral motto. Its use at the beginning of a text means that the author pays their respects to the global free market and free trade philosophy and that all that will be said later fits into the right line. Nevertheless, this concept is one of the most ambiguous of all and may lead to exactly opposite policies. On the one hand, trying to maintain or improve a level playing field can inspire more free market measures, exacerbating competition, deregulating more sectors and so on. On the other hand, it could lead to taking reciprocity measures aiming at protecting free entry on the market and imposing conditions to competitors who did not respect this very principle on their own market. Though the long term goals are the same, what is interesting is that the same words can have dramatically different consequences in the short term. 'Level playing field' as an expression is therefore to be used and received carefully. [1]"

Leverage in banking is the ratio of lending to equity - just like the larger the gear the more oomph it has. [2]ExampleThe trouble was that in the run-up to the global financial crisis a lot of banks did more and more lending without raising any extra equity. They were able to ""game"" the system, as the Basel Committee says, either by using off-balance-sheet vehicles or through other ruses. In future, there will be global limits on banks' leverage.

lifetime allowance,"There is no limit to the amount that an individual can save towards their pension, but there is a limit on the amount of tax relief on pension savings. The lifetime allowance is the maximum amount of pension saving that can be built up by an individual during their lifetime that qualifies for tax relief. Generally the amount of pension saving is tested against the lifetime allowance when the pension benefits are taken, and any excess is taxed. There are special rules for taxpayers who had built up large pension savings before the lifetime allowance was introduced from  A-day  in April 2006 and other protection mechanisms for those in similar positions each time the lifetime limit has been subsequently reduced. [1]   lifetime allowance in the news The chancellor said in the UK Budget 2015 that the lifetime allowance, which governs limits on tax breaks for pension savings, is to be cut from  1.25m to  1m from April 2016, its third reduction since the coalition came to power in 2010. Any savings above the cap, when a pension is taken, will be taxed at 55 per cent. The government estimates that only 4 per cent of pension savers currently approaching retirement will be affected, but the move will save the Exchequer about  600m a year. The chancellor also announced that the lifetime allowance will be linked to inflation,  to ensure those still building up their pension pots are protected . [2]"

Some markets are highly liquid; some are relatively illiquid. [1]The term also means how easy it is to perform a transaction in a particular security or instrument. A liquid security, such as a share in a large listed company or a sovereign bond, is easy to price and can be bought or sold without significant price impact. With an illiquid instrument, trying to buy or sell may change the price, if it is even possible to transact. [2]ExampleBanks need to hold enough to cover expected demands from depositors, creditors and counterparties. During the global financial crisis it became clear that many assets were a lot harder to sell than banks had expected.

liquidity crisis," A situation where depositors demand larger withdrawals than normal and banks are forced to borrow funds at an elevated interest rate. A liquidity crisis is usually unpredictable and can be due to either a lack of confidence in the specific bank, or some unexpected need for cash. Liquidity crises can ultimately result in  a run on a bank  and even the insolvency of the bank. Example According to the Treasury report, Northern Rock, the first bank failure in the 2007-8 banking crises followed a  reckless business model  where nearly 30% of its funding was bought-in short-term wholesale funds that were used to finance long-term mortgage business. The bank was over-dependent on liability management to finance its credit business.  This is a process where banks manage liabilities, for example customer deposits, and borrow funds when needed from the markets for interbank deposits, large-sized time deposits and certificates of deposit (CD). When wholesale funding dried up the bank had a liquidity crisis that rapidly turned into a capital crisis.[1] "

list systems,"A form of proportional representation in which parties submit lists for multimember constituencies. An 'open list' lets voters choose candidates from within the same party. Under a 'closed list' system, the vote is cast for party, not candidate.   ProsA proportional outcome.  Easier to understand than STV. Similar to the current system but with multimember constituencies. A single X required on a ballot paper.    Places less emphasis on individuals and reduces importance of tactical voting.   ConsMore coalition government is likely, unless constituencies are very small and give an advantage to bigger parties. A closed list gives the party leadership the power to determine the candidate list, which constrains voter choice.  [1]"

loan performance pricing,"Performance pricing provisions in bank loans link the interest rate to a measure of the company's credit risk. Provisions may be either tied to the group's credit rating (rating triggers) or to an accounting measure of risk, such as the leverage or the debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Performance pricing therefore allows to reduce interest payments whenever the borrowing company's credit quality improves and to increase the interest if the credit quality deteriorates. Example Currently, more than half of all loans drawn down by listed US firms contain performance pricing provisions. According to recent research, these contract provisions appear to reduce a group's credit risk, for instance by alleviating risk-shifting incentives, as the interest to be paid can be shown to be consistently lower than in comparable contracts with fixed interest rates. [1]"
loan shark,"A loan shark is an illegal moneylender who often charges very high interest rates. The term is also used informally to describe registered money lenders charging very high rates such as payday lenders.   loan sharks in the news In December 2012 there were fears of a shadow banking crisis in China. Many of the illegal loan shark operations in Wenzhou had imploded meaning that long chains of underground financing deals, often at predatory interest rates, had collapsed. The fallout hit the fomal banking system which experienced a rise in the non-performing loan ratio to 3 per cent from 0.4 per cent a year earlier. However, as loan sharks were concentrated in Wenzhou there were few ripples beyond the city. The trusts, wealth management products and entrusted loan operations that are China's shadow banks remained unaffected. In January 2012 a Greek prosecutor launched a criminal probe of more than 50 people accused of involvement in a loan shark network in the northern port city of Thessaloniki."

loan-loss provision,"The money a bank sets aside to cover potential losses on loans. [1] For instance, a bank gives a out a loan of  100, and the interest rate is five per cent, so the income is  5 every year.  Let us assume that the bank will get its money back in 12 months. If after six months the bank thinks that the borrower will default, then it can create a provision for the estimated loss. Let us assume that  40 is set aside as a provision as the bank is expecting to get  60 back, so it would increase its losses by  40.  If the bank recovers  65, then a profit is made. Example Imagine you are the accountant of a bank which has provided a loan of  1m to an employee of a company so that s/he can buy a house of an estimated value of  1 m based on recent transactions.  The house is used as collateral for the loan. After several months without any transactions, the owner of a similar house loses his job. Desperate to secure cash, he puts his property up for sale.  A buyer pays   0.5 m. for this house. The question you face as an accountant is, what is the economic value of the first house,  1 m,  0.5m or something in the middle  If you say  0.5m, then you may need to make a provision of  0.5m. This is how accounting is related to judgments on provision.  The key question, is whether this transaction offers enough to go on to assess the economic price of a similar asset.  As there are no clear rules, there is plenty of room for subjective assessment. A conservative bank may create an allowance for  0.5m, a more aggressive bank may not provide one at all. This creates uncertainty surrounding the financial health of some banks during the downturn as large and complex balance sheets make it very difficult for anyone to estimate the fair value of many loans.

lock-up agreement,"Underwriters in IPOs and insiders of the issuing company agree on lock-ups to prevent the insiders from selling their stock within a given time window after the IPO. This time window normally amounts to 180 days. The lock-up agreement attempts to ensure the stability of the issuing company and to align insiders' incentives with the goals of the company. After the expiration of the lock-up period, insiders are free to sell, but potentially have to take into account insider regulation prevalent in many countries. Empirical evidence shows that the expiration of the lock-up agreements is often associated with negative stock returns for the company's stock. ExampleAn underwriter might, for example, be concerned that the pre-IPO owners of a firm may know that their firm is overvalued or even engaged in window dressing to let the firm appear as profitable as possible. By restricting their stock sales for a certain period of time, the underwriter hopes that markets use this time before the lock-up expiration to figure out the true value of a company. Insiders could thus be deterred from engaging in opportunistic behaviour before or at the IPO. [1]"

logistics,"Logistics is a subset of supply chain management that focuses on the challenge of planning and coordinating the flow of materials and information. Flow progresses from upstream (raw material) to downstream (the end-customer).  The logistics task can be broken down into four major activities:  Inbound logistics: deals with the focal company and its upstream suppliers Outbound logistics: refers to links between the focal company and its downstream customers Internal logistics: deals with planning and control of material flow within the boundaries of the focal company Reverse logistics: the return of goods in the opposite direction to the normal flow (i.e., from downstream to upstream). These goods include product returns, repairs, maintenance and end-of-life returns for recycling and dismantling.  Example A retailer cannot generate sales without stock, and is constantly walking the tightrope between too much stock and not enough.  Logistics in retailing is concerned with getting the balance right.  Essentially, this means having the right product on shelf in the stores in the right quantity at the right time. The role of information flow is to share today s demand information from the till (by means of point of sale systems, POS) with suppliers.  Retail POS enable checkout data to be used to update both inventories (to find out how much is in stock) and demand forecasts (to find out how many of each item do we think the consumer will buy tomorrow/ next week). Updated demand forecasts in turn trigger replenishment orders onto suppliers, The role of material flow is the fulfillment of replenishment orders for each item from suppliers through the retailer s distribution centres to the stores. [1]"
logistics strategy,"Logistics is not confined to tactical decisions about transportation and warehousing.  Longer-term decisions are needed to put in place the capabilities that ensure that logistics plays a full role in supporting a company s products in the market place.As such capabilities increasingly involve partners in a supply chain, the implications of this  full role  extend far beyond the boundaries of the company itself.  Logistics strategy is the set of guiding principles, driving forces and ingrained attitudes that help to coordinate goals, plans and policies between partners across a given supply chain. Example If the links in a supply chain are directed at different competitive priorities, then the chain will not be able to serve the end-customer as well as a chain in which the links are directed at the same priorities.  This is the idea of  focus , which is based on the view that you cannot be good at everything.  Where links in a supply chain are directed at a common and consistent set of goals that are based on the priorities most valued by the end-customer, that supply chain will compete better in the market place than one in which the links have different, conflicting priorities. All too often, for example, a focus on cost cutting by the management of the day is at odds with the more fundamental priorities of reliability and speed. While profitability may be improved this financial year, long term damage may well have been caused to the supply chain s ability to compete. It is difficult to handle high volume, low cost products in the same distribution channel as low volume, high variety products. Logistics processes for classic shirts (styles that last a long time and do not date) are sourced separately from fashion blouses. Classic shirts are sourced from low cost economies where price is key and delivery times are less important because the product life cycle is long. Fashion blouses (styles that are in season and may date quickly) are sources closer to the home market because response time is key, and cost is less important. [1]"

long tail,"A long tail distribution is one of the heavy tail distribution curves in statistics that includes fat tails. They are characterised by kurtosis, which is derived from greek name for the arched bell shape of the distribution graph. A long tailed distribution differs from a fat tailed distribution in that it includes a longer tail (data points that are -4 or +4 standard deviations from the mean). Long tails can be said to be desirable in some contexts. In online markets, for example, companies have found ways to take advantage of long tails. Amazon, for example, has been able to sell rare books in a way that bricks-and-mortar bookshops will have found hard to do because the chances of someone coming into the shop to buy the rare books they stock is so slim. Amazon does not have to maintain an inventory, however, and can offer all rare books because the likelihood that someone will search for at least one rare book is high.   long tails in the news In April 2013, Nick Butler, visiting professor and chair of the the Kings Policy Institute at Kings College London, was writing in the FT about oil and gas. He said 56 years after the first gas was produced at the West Sole field in UK, the prospect is for another two more decades of production. ""Total output is down, but there is a long tail."""

long-term refinancing operation - LTRO,"The European Central Bank's long-term refinancing operation is a process by which the ECB provides financing to eurozone banks. The stated aim of the LTRO is to maintain a cushion of liquidity for banks holding illiquid assets, and thus prevent interbank lending and other loan origination from seizing up as they did in the credit squeeze of 2008.The ECB also provides liquidity to banks through its main refinancing operations, which have two-week and one-month maturities. Until early 2008, the longest LTRO maturity was three months. Since then the ECB has successively introduced six-month, 12-month and 36-month terms for LTRO finance. Each of these new issues has been heavily subscribed, with eurozone periphery banks in Ireland, Italy, Spain and Greece taking the majority of the first 36-month issue in late 2011. The second 36-month issue in February 2012 was closely watched as an indicator of the health of eurozone banks.The collateral posted to the ECB is valued by applying a haircut to its market value, where the size of the haircut depends on three factors - the type of asset, time until maturity, and its credit rating. Credit ratings are broken down into three classes corresponding to 'double A' or above, 'single A', and 'triple B', on a 'second-best' basis. Eg. to fall into class 2, a security would have to be rated single A or above by at least two major agencies. Alternative forms of rating are acceptable for bank loans which are not rated by the major agencies. The ECB has waived the credit rating requirement for Greek, Portugese and Irish sovereign debt, although it briefly suspended Greek government debt from being used as collateral when it was rated as 'selective default' by S&P.;A large portion of the financing provided to eurozone banks through the LTRO was used to buy periphery sovereign debt. This became known as the 'Sarko trade' after Nicolas Sarkozy suggested that the LTRO meant that the Italian and Spanish governments could depend on their countries' banks to buy their bonds. The ECB is not allowed to provide direct support to Eurozone governments. [1]"

longevity bond,"Life expectancy has steadily increased since the 1960s and is now among the key risks for pension funds, insurers and other companies that have under-estimated longevity risks - the risk that people will live longer than expected - and are seeking ways to meet their growing obligations. Banks and other market participants have devised variations of  mortality bonds , whose value fall if deaths occur earlier than expected, and  longevity bonds  which move the opposite way. [1] Longevity bonds help pension schemes cope with increased life expectancy [2] These bonds are financial instruments that absorb the costs of providing pensions of people living to be very old and are often used by pension funds and annuity providers. [3] ViewEveryone wins if UK issues longevity bond"
longevity swap,"This is a derivative contract that offsets the risk of pension scheme members living longer than expected. This is a scheme that makes regular payments based on agreed mortality assumptions to an investment bank or insurer and, in return, the bank or insurer pays out amounts based on the scheme s actual mortality rates. [1]. This mirrors the structure of an interest rate or inflation swap. [2] For example, the fixed rate of interest here is an agreed projection   say, over 25 years   of the annual mortality rate. The floating rate is the actual outcome. Both parties agree that   for instance   of 100,000 65-year olds, 2,000 should die in year one and so forth. If the figure turns out higher, one party has to put up collateral, and vice versa. The mortality projections used are the result of complex actuarial calculations   in other words, a model. [3]Pension schemes keep assets and so retain investment and inflation risks. The swap counterparty is usually an investment bank, which then lays off most, if not all, of the risk to a reinsurer or into the capital markets. Trustees pay a fixed regular premium to offload the risks that they will have to keep paying out pensions to retirees for longer than planned for. Investment bank and reinsurer pay a floating premium in return, which increases the longer people live. [4] ViewTackling the longevity questionDeveloping a market for longevity risk"

The loonie in the news In January 2014 it was reported that the loonie (the Canadian dollar) had weakened to more than $1.10 to the US dollar for the first time since 2010. The fall meant the loonie had fallen 17 per cent against the US dollar in less than three years. The bet against the loonie looked crowded, but an FT writer pointed out that is was only one of a group of disliked investments including the Australian dollar, emerging markets and mining shares    all connected to commodities prices.

lost decade,"Lost decade is a term that is is now loosely applied to any 10-year period of economic stagnation for any entity, be it a company or a country. However, the term is commonly applied to the situation Japan found itself in during the 1990s after a bubble in land and stock prices burst. Japan put off restructuring the banking system producing a protracted deflationary environment that some argue lasted until the present times, effectively producing two lost decades. There has been further debate on how much Japan really suffered during its 'lost decade'.   lost decade in the news In April 2013, a columnist considered the implications of Japan's lost decade on its status with international investors. He pointed out that few international fund managers now have deep coverage in Japan. Abenomics could change that, although the yen's subsequent depreciation has limited overseas' investors ability to profit from any upside on Japanese stocks. In May 2013, experts warned the British pub industry was facing a lost decade with sales unlikely to return to 2007 levels for another five years."

lowball,"To lowball is to deliberately offer a price that is below the fair value of the market in order to create a false impression or to put pressure on a seller who needs to liquidate assets quickly.   lowball in the news The term lowball came to have a wider meaning, however, during the Libor scandal. Some banks were accused of lowballing their Libor bids during the height of the financial crisis in 2008. There had even been concerns about lowballing dating back to 2007 when the Bank of England's Sterling Money Market Liaison Group had noted: ""Several group members thought that Libor fixings had been lower than actual traded interbank rates through the period of stress"". At the end of December 2012, a report published by the UK Financial Services Authority suggested that UBS attempted to manipulate Libor rates not only to benefit its trading book, but also to paint a rosier picture of its financial health when credit markets dried up. Senior management at UBS, it said, had issued directives to lowball Libor submissions so that the bank did not attract negative media comment about its creditworthiness."
loyalty bonus,A sum of money that someone is paid as a reward for being a regular customer or for continuing to work for someone. [1] 
loyalty card,"A card given by a shop, supermarket etc that gives regular customers lower prices, money back on goods etc. [1] "
loyalty programme," Companies often try and drive behavioural loyalty through the simple frequency programmes (FPs) that are designed to reward customers who buy frequently and in substantial amounts (for example, every fifth purchase is free), or through more complex loyalty/ membership programmes that have a much wider range of objectives according to different levels of membership. The latter aims to develop long-term, cost-effective links between an organisation and its customers for the mutual benefit of both parties such as enhancing convenience like having customer data such as billing and credit card information, customer preferences readily available. This enables segmentation of the customer base or the grouping of customers to allow the identification of the most and least profitable customer relationships.  For instance, customers can be grouped by revenue into different membership levels, and then offering different tailored services such as enhanced customisation, priority and higher level services based on that membership. ExampleCaesars Entertainment Corporation (CEC) is the world's largest casino entertainment company, owning or managing casino resorts on four continents.  The company's resorts operate primarily under the Harrah's, Caesars and Horseshoe brand names.  Caesars also owns the London Clubs International family of casinos and the World Series of Poker. The group s loyalty programme, called Total Rewards (www.TotalRewards.com), is a leader in the use of highly sophisticated loyalty programmes. Harrah s was first to launch a tiered customer loyalty programme in the gaming industry which has now been extended to all CEC s brands. Today, it has five tiers in its programme: Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Seven Stars, and Chairman s Club. The programme is integrated across all of its properties and services. Customers identify themselves (and earn points) at every touchpoint throughout the company, ranging from its gaming tables, restaurants, and hotels to the gift shops and shows. The points collected can be used to obtain cash, merchandise, lodging, show tickets, vacations and events. What is special about CEC is not its loyalty programme, but what it does with the information about its customers when they use their cards to earn points. At the backend, CEC has linked all of its databases from casino management, hotel reservations and events to get an holistic view of each of its customers. CEC now has detailed data on over 42 million of its customers and knows their preferences and behaviours ranging from how much they spend on each type of game and their likes in food and drinks, to entertainment and lodging preferences. All of this information about the customer is captured in real time. CEC uses this data to drive its marketing and on-site customer service. For example, if a Diamond card holder on slot machine 278 signals for service in a Harrah s property, a Harrah s associate is able to ask,  The usual, Mr. Jones   and then track the time it takes for a server to fill the guest s request. In another example, when a customer wins a jackpot, Harrah s can tailor a reward that celebrates that win. Harrah s also knows when a customer is approaching his maximum gaming limit on a particular evening and therefore, when the customer is likely to stop playing. Just before the limit is reached, Harrah s can offer him a heavily discounted ticket in real time via text message for a show with available seats. This method keeps the customers on the premises (and perhaps keep them spending), makes them feel valued as they get a special deal just when they wanted to stop playing. Also, this utilises otherwise wasted capacity in its shows and restaurants. [1]  "

made-for-china,"Products or services designed specifically to meet the needs of Chinese consumers. In some cases, such goods may also be launched in other countries. The made-for-China label stands in contrast to the 'Made in China' tag for products sourced in China. The made-for-China phenomenon is spurred by three drivers. First, there is the sheer size of the China market. Second, many multinationals these days recognise that Chinese consumers have needs and preferences that can be very distinct from those in other markets. For instance, many Chinese owners of luxury cars do not drive them themselves but use a chauffeur. Hence, the need for extra space and comfort in the back of these cars. Finally, the firm may create a new brand specifically for the China market in order not to dilute the core flagship brand. Example In September 2010 Herm s launched Shang Xia in China. The new brand was created in China by a Chinese team, inspired by Chinese culture, and based on Chinese craftsmanship. Herm s opened its first store in Shanghai. Initially, the brand covered homeware products. Herm s planned to roll out Shang Xia to other countries if it were successful in China. A key motivation for keeping the new brand separate from the Herm s parent brand is not to confuse the customers. [1] Link Article - Herm s creates bespoke brand for China"

make-or-buy,A make-or-buy decision involves deciding whether to make a product yourself or to have it made for you by a supplier. [1] 
make-or-take pricing,"Make-or-take pricing refers to the system by which some stock, options, and futures exchanges collect fees for arranging trades.  These exchanges arrange trades by allowing patient traders to post standing limit orders that indicate the prices at which they are willing to buy or sell, and the associated quantities. A standing limit order is a limit order that has been submitted to an exchange which cannot be filled immediately when it arrives because no trader is willing to trade at the limit price of the order.  It will stand at the exchange waiting until a trader is willing to trade at that price.  A standing orders may never fill if it is a buy order with a low limit price or a sell order with a high limit price. These traders then wait until other traders are willing to trade with them.  When other traders see prices at which they are willing to trade, they submit market orders or marketable limit orders to take these trading opportunities. A marketable limit order is a buy order with a price at or above the lowest offer in the market or a sell order with a price at or below the highest bid in the market. The patient customers are said to make a market by allowing other traders to trade when they want to trade.  They are called makers.  The other traders are called takers.  The makers provide liquidity - the ability to trade when you want to trade - while the takers take their liquidity. At exchanges that use the make-or-take pricing system, takers pay an access fee to trade with the standing orders that makers have posted at the exchange.  These exchanges rebate a portion of that access fee to the makers in payments called liquidity rebates.  The alternative to make-or-take pricing is the transaction fee pricing system in which the buyer and seller, or sometimes just the seller, pay a fee to the exchange for arranging their trades.  Example For stocks trading in the US, the typical access fee is 0.3 cents per share and the typical liquidity rebate is 0.2 cents per share.  Thus, the exchange nets 0.1 cent per share for each transaction that it arranges. Make or take exchanges have smaller quoted bid/ ask spreads than transaction fee exchanges.  The liquidity rebate subsidises makers who post bids and offers.  This subsidy allows them to post more aggressive prices - higher bids and lower offers than they otherwise would post. The access fee increases the cost of taking those better prices. A better price is a higher bid or a lower offer. In competitive markets, the access fee will offset the narrower spreads, so that the cost of trading at both types of exchanges will be the same, all other things being equal. [1]"

management buy-out,"When management, often with outside financial backing, acquires all outstanding shares in a company and takes the company private."
management buy-out (MBO),"A management buy-out (MBO) is an acquisition in which the acquiring group is led by the company's own management and executives. The key difference between an MBO and a regular acquisition (takeover) is that the company is bought by its own management rather than by another company or by a group of outside investors. Managers are rarely wealthy enough to buy the company on their own and additional funds may have to be raised, usually under the form of debt financing. MBOs therefore often take the form of a leveraged buy-out (LBO), where a large part of the purchase price is debt financed and the remaining equity is privately held by a small group of investors.  The MBO may also be financed by private equity investors who receive shares in the new company in return for their money. What do managers and shareholders gain from agreeing to an MBO  A public company that is acquired by its management is taken private. Obvious gains from going private are the savings from reduced registration and listing costs, less stringent regulatory and disclosure requirements, and the elimination of shareholder servicing costs. These savings can be significant for smaller groups. A second benefit is the reduction in the management-shareholder agency costs. If managers own the company then this increases their incentives to work harder and to make decisions that are in the long term interest of the firm. Finally, the substantial amount of debt often loaded upon the firm as a result of a MBO forces managers to make the firm leaner and more efficient. One important consideration regarding MBOs is that managers usually have more information about a company than outside shareholders. This could lead to a conflict of interests where managers try to buy the company when they have inside information that indicates that the future of the company is better than previously expected. In other words, managers may try to buy the company on the cheap when it is undervalued. Outside shareholders know, however, that managers have an informational advantage and therefore demand a higher price in order to sell their ownership. Managers may therefore have to share some of the gains from the MBO with outside shareholders.  Example Menzies Hotel was bought in 2011 by its management after the parent company, Piccadilly Hotels, went into administration. The sale resulted in a financial restructuring of Menzies Hotels, in agreement with its lender (Lloyds Banking Group), under a new company called Cordial Hotels. The company is now majority-owned by the management team.[1]"

management processes,"Management processes are the methods that aid the structuring, investigation, analysis, decision-making and communication of business issues. Examples include the strategic planning process, talent planning, expense and capital budgeting, performance management systems, product planning and management cost accounting. The purpose of a management process is to ensure a disciplined and consistent approach to analysis and decision making. They facilitate the use of a logical thought process that is consistent with the objectives of the firm.  The capital budgeting process, for example, is based on financial market disciplines that encourage wise investment.  Product planning is focused on both creating customer value and realising the benefits of new products for the firm s investors, not one or the other. Management processes should be seen as a support to and not a replacement for management judgment.  These processes require the development of expectations about the future and provide guidance in light of the associated assumptions.  The wise manager uses these tools as inputs to decision making which, when combined with business acumen, provide a solid basis for choice. Example In most towns, restaurants come and go, but there are a few that manage to stay in business over long periods of time.  Why do some succeed while so many others fail   Attention to customer-oriented product planning, service process effectiveness, workforce management, effective management accounting and other management processes are the likely differentiators.

margin of safety,"The difference between the intrinsic value of a stock and the price below which value investors will be willing to make an investment in the given stock. It is a means by which value investors protect their capital and their portfolios from downside risk.ExampleFor value investors protecting one's capital is of paramount importance. As a result, and recognising that valuation is subjective and quite uncertain as it deals with the future which is uncertain, value investors will not buy a stock until it has fallen significantly below its intrinsic value. The estimation of intrinsic value is subject to a lot of subjective judgments, so value investors have borrowed a term from engineering, the margin of safety, to make sure their portfolios have sufficient downside protection. Originally, Benjamin Graham (financial strategist at Columbia University) talked about a 50 per cent margin of safety; contemporary value investors normally use a 33 per cent margin of safety as the larger the margin of safety, the smaller the probability that one will find truly undervalued stocks. If a stock is valued at $10/share based on the company s assets and free cash flows, yet is trading at a price of less than $6.66/share, this stock would qualify as a truly undervalued stock and as a value investment. In this case, the stock is trading at a discount to the intrinsic value of more than 33 per cent - that gives an investor room for error. [1] This term is also used to describe the amount of sales that are in excess of a company s breakeven point. [2] "

margin trading,"Also called buying on margin. A method of buying shares that involves borrowing a part of the sum needed from the broker executing the transaction. The collateral for the loan is normally securities in the investor's account. The investor must deposit an initial amount of cash or securities (initial margin or margin requirement) into a margin account with the broker, and must thereafter maintain a minimum amount of cash or securities (margin) in the account as collateral (maintenance margin, minimum maintenance or maintenance requirement). If the balance of a margin account falls below the minimum maintenance amount, the broker makes a margin call to the investor for the funds needed. Margin balances can be adjusted to reflect market values by adding or subtracting variation margins. Buying on margin gives the investor leverage as any capital appreciation or dividend income is on the total amount purchased. Even after the amount borrowed has been repaid to the broker, with interest, the investor could still be better off than if he/she had personally financed the purchase of a smaller amount of shares. That depends on how much the shares gain and how much they yield. Margin trading also carries some risk - if the shares fall in value, the investor suffers a capital loss while also facing potential margin calls from the broker."

market for corporate control,"Market for corporate control, sometimes called external corporate control, usually comes into play when a firm s internal governance (board of directors) fails. It often refers to a takeover market where underperforming or undervalued firms become attractive takeover targets by potential acquirers. When firms perform poorly it often reflects poor internal governance and therefore external governance control will kick in. Potential acquirers might buy up a large amount of a target firm s equity in order to take control of the board and subsequently replace the top management team because poor performance often reflects poor management. The aim of a takeover is to revitalise a poorly run company and achieve higher profitability after restructuring. Potential acquirers believe that they can manage the target firm more effectively than the current set of the top management team. The threat of takeover can serve as a last governance mechanism by aligning the interests and goals between executives and shareholders and thus put additional pressure on managers to perform more efficiently. To oppose hostile or unfriendly takeover, executives of the target firm might implement different defense tactics - such as  poison pills  (see below) or asset restructuring - to safeguard their own employment and wealth. For instance, asset restructuring refers to executives  strategic action of changing the firm s business portfolio through sell-offs or spin-offs in order to make the firm less attractive as a takeover target. To facilitate the takeover deal, acquiring firms sometimes offer selective executives of the target firm a lump sum of cash, stock options or other benefits (for example a  golden parachute ) as incentives for these executives to terminate their employment at the target firm. Although external governance control can be a disciplinary method for ineffectual top management, it does not always work because takeover market may not be active, and in several countries takeover activities are highly restricted and regulated by the local government agencies. Example Conrail Rail Corporation, an underperforming US railroad operator, became a takeover target by CSX Transportation in 1997. CSX determined that Conrail was an inefficient railroad operator in an attractive market. As the CSX-Contrail deal was under negotiation, the managers from both companies employed a number of anti-takeover devices including a poison pill (giving each shareholder the right to purchase one additional share at a 50 per cent discount), a break-up fee of $300m, and lock-up options to avoid takeover attempts from other bidders. These antitakeover tactics can discourage competing offers because they make it very costly for any bidders besides CSX to acquire Conrail (Harvard Business Case). [1]"

market fragmentation,"The term refers to how financial markets are structured.  Typically, a market can be either 'concentrated', where most, if not all, trading in a set of securities is conducted in one or two trading centers, or 'fragmented' where investors send orders to numerous trading venues that all compete with each other for order flow.  A trading venue can be a physical place like the floor of the New York Stock Exchange or a virtual meeting place like Nasdaq s electronic market for trading stocks.  There is a clear trade-off between concentrated and fragmented markets, as concentrated markets can potentially provide greater depth, higher certainty of order execution, and greater transparency in terms of pricing information. However, a concentrated market can lead to monopolistic behaviour where the exchange operator might have the incentive to raise trading costs and stifle innovation. In contrast, a fragmented market provides the benefits of more competition for order flow and greater incentives to introduce innovative new ways to trade securities.  These benefits, however, might be offset by potentially greater search costs to find sufficient liquidity, reduced transparency in security prices, and greater uncertainty of order execution. In financial markets that are larger and more developed, the current trend has been towards more fragmented markets, as the benefits of several competing trading venues (connected via high-speed computers and communications links) appear to outweigh the advantages of a concentrated market structure. Example A good example of the trend towards more fragmented markets can be seen in the proliferation of trading venues for stocks in the US, where the market shares of NYSE and Nasdaq have declined sharply as dozens of newer market operators have developed potentially cheaper and faster systems to trade NYSE- and Nasdaq-listed stocks.[1] View Article: EU policymakers question new OTC trading system "

market maker,"An institution or individual that quotes bid and offer prices for specific stocks or other marketable securities that it holds in inventory (often referred to as 'makes a market in'), and is prepared and able to buy or sell those securities at any time on its own account. Note that this is not necessarily the same as a brokerage house, as a broker typically acts as an agent for a customer and charges a commission for helping to consummate a trade with another investor (rather than acting like a market maker who serves as a 'principal' by buying or selling from its own inventory of securities).  Market makers are normally tasked with providing sufficient liquidity in order to reduce volatility in prices and maintain a 'fair and orderly market' for stocks.  For example, they will typically buy a stock when there are few or no other bidders in the market yet many investors wish to sell this security. By doing so, market makers can instill greater investor confidence in the financial markets and encourage these investors to send more orders to these trading centers.  This can create a virtuous cycle where these additional orders result in greater depth and liquidity which, in turn, attract even more investors and orders. Thus, market makers can play an important role in terms of building and maintaining efficient and highly liquid financial markets. On the London Stock Exchange, market makers are called jobbers whereas on the New York Stock Exchange they are now referred to as designated market makers (formerly known as 'specialists').[1] View Getco acquires BofA market-making slots   "

market over-reaction / market under-reaction,"A challenge to the efficient market hypothesis is that individuals often over- or under-react to news.  If over-reactions and under-reactions are split randomly, then these biased reactions could still be consistent with the efficient market hypothesis. However, psychological factors suggest that there are systematic patterns of over-reaction and under-reaction. For example, individuals tend to be conservative and rely too much on their prior beliefs, and hence they under-react to news. On the other hand, information that is salient and prominent captures people s attention and becomes more important in the decision making process. People assign a heavier weight to such information in forming new beliefs, resulting in over-reaction. Prices can therefore deviate from their fair or rational market value at least temporarily.  Example Some corporate events show post-event return continuation: average subsequent return has the same sign as the event-date stock price reaction. This is usually viewed as evidence of under-reaction to news. Events that are associated with post-event return continuation include stock splits; tender offer and open market repurchases; equity carveouts; spinoffs; accounting write-offs; analyst earnings forecast revisions; analyst stock recommendations; dividend initiations and omissions; seasoned issues of debt and common stock; public announcement of previous insider trades; and venture capital share distributions.

market segmentation,"Technically, market segmentation is the process of dividing the population of possible customers into distinct groups. Those customers within the same segment share common characteristics that can help a firm in targeting those customers and marketing to them effectively (adapted from Lovelock and Wirtz 2011). Segmentation is one of the most important concepts in marketing.  Firms vary widely in their abilities to serve different types of customers. Hence, rather than trying to compete in an entire market, firms should segment the market. Through the process of market segmentation, firms will identify those parts, or sections of the market, that they can serve best. There are many ways to segment the market, including the following common ways and these approaches can be used in combination:  Demographic segmentation, such as age, gender, income, has been widely used. That works well, when demographics are highly associated with needs and wants.  However, such an association may often not be the case, as two people with the exact same demographic characteristics may have very different needs and therefore exhibit different buying behaviours. Psychographic segmentation has become more popular as it reflects people s lifestyles, attitudes and aspirations. Psychographic segmentation can be very useful in strengthening brand identity and creating an emotional connection with the brand, but may not necessarily result in sales. Behavioural segmentation is based on product consumption-related behaviours and can include frequency, volume and type of product usage. This type of segmentation can be very powerful for firms that have a membership-type relationship with customers, for example, via a contract such as banks and telecommunications providers, or via loyalty programmes. Here, firms can exactly observe consumption behaviour.  A drawback is that firms typically can only observe the behaviour with regard to their own products, but not those of their competitors. Needs-based segmentation groups customers based on similar needs and wants, or benefits sought, with regards to a particular product or consumption context. Needs-based segmentation is perhaps the segmentation truest to the marketing concept, that is, satisfying customers  needs and wants.  For companies to increase their sales, segmentation requires understanding customer needs, including those that are underserved or even unmet.  Example Contiki Holiday (www.contiki.com ) is an example of a company that focuses on serving a need. Some single people do not want to join tours that include mostly families. They prefer a holiday where they can meet people with similar preferences. Hence, Contiki Holiday serves this group of people. It is a worldwide leader in holidays for those in the 18-35 age group (demographic segmentation). The holiday packages are aimed at the fun-loving youth group (psychographic segmentation). To cater to different lifestyles and budget (a combination of psychographic and demographic segmentation), Contiki further segmented its packages. For example, those going to Continental Europe can choose between:  Camping - for people who are very outgoing and do not mind roughing it; Concept/ budget - for those who want more for their time and money such as staying in budget backpacker style accommodation; Time out/ Superior - with lots of sightseeing, free time, extra excursions and stays in superior class tourist hotels.

materiality matrix,"A materiality matrix enables a company to decide which CSR (corporate social responsibility) initatives to invest in. The total value created by a CSR initiative can broadly be broken down into business and societal values. Business value refers to the favorable stakeholder behaviours resulting from the initiative such as purchasing the company s products, investing in the company, or otherwise helping the company reach its goals. In contrast, societal value refers to the direct social benefits (such as healthier lifestyles) and/or environmental benefits (for example, increased recycling) that result from the CSR initiative. The matrix plots CSR issues in terms of two dimensions: the importance or attractiveness of the issue to stakeholders and the importance of the issue to the company in terms of the likely influence of the initiative(s) on business success. ExampleAllianz (insurance company) analyses megatrends internally and does regular stakeholder surveys to create its materiality matrix. For example. in 2010, climate change and employee satisfaction emerge as priority issues both for Allianz and its stakeholders, while issues such as ""social disparities"" turns out to be of much smaller concern to the company and its stakeholders.

maternal body,"The term  maternal body  describes women s embodied potential for getting pregnant, giving birth, and becoming a mother, with responsibility for nurturing (and perhaps breastfeeding) infant children. Feminist research on organisational cultures has observed how some employers are hostile towards the maternal body. In the context of such antipathy, employer commitment towards expectant and new mothers is reduced. Contradictions are notable between equal opportunities policies (aimed at protecting pregnant and newly maternal employees) and occupational discrimination relating to women s capacity for reproduction. As the distinguished sociologist Joan Acker has suggested, women s maternal bodies and their capacity to procreate, become pregnant and breastfeed, may be used as grounds for exclusion of women from career opportunities.  The term  maternal body  is sometimes used more broadly, beyond the specific boundaries of  motherhood  (i.e pregnancy, birth and the mothering of infant children) and is extended to include menstruation, non-motherhood and menopause.   the maternal body as an issue in the news The problems faced by employed pregnant women and new mothers remain hotly debated. In an interview with Alice Eagly, Rebecca Knight observes how new mothers are often sidelined into part-time work and face barriers to career progress. Similarly in 2010 Lucy Kellaway considers how flexibility can and should be offered to working mothers with children, and acknowledges that mothers can sometimes experience hostile treatment when trying to juggle childcare and paid work.[1]"

measuring housebuilding,"The measurement of housebuilding is vital not only for the housing market but also for calculating national income and growth - getting the figure right is essential to an understanding what is currently happening to a national economy. However, housebuilding is not that easy to measure and the different approaches are time dependent. The first problem is that houses come in all shapes and sizes, which all require different amounts of building effort. So, one approach is to ask builders the value of their housing work. Unfortunately, the responses may not be accurate or comprehensive, as much building may be by hard to track small firms or informal in nature. The other way is simply to count the dwelling units themselves, either taking some account of size variations by recording the dwelling areas built or by simply adding up the number of units. The loss of accuracy is then outweighed by the knowledge that new homes generally have to be registered with some official agency, where their existence can be picked up. Then, to add further complication, there are several measures of housebuilding at distinct stages of what can be a lengthy process spread over a number of years: - Housing permits are regulatory permissions that enable a builder to start work on a site. However, the builder may not start work immediately or decide not to build at all, say, because market conditions have deteriorated. - Housing starts record when builders actually commence work on specific dwellings but then the build time itself may vary in the same way as for permits. - Housing completions specify when buildings have been finished, though not necessarily sold. The time lag between starts and completions can be lengthy and it is variable, depending partly on market conditions. Permits are the most leading of the three measures, while completions identify decisions made in the past. [1]"

media relations," Every company s corporate communication, media relations and public relations department are responsible for managing its relationships with the media. Originally, media relations were based on relationships with reporters that were built up over a long period of time.  Public relations professionals built up large files of information about reporters over meetings. Today, media relations is a more scientific process based on an analysis of the reporters' previous work, their point of view on a particular topic and their previous interactions.Corporations try to manage relationships with the media both for traditional publications and television channels as well as social media outlets by creating news, known as a proactive approach.  Corporations can also distribute press releases or respond to calls when reporters are developing stories, known as a reactive approach.The measurement of media relations has become a business in itself as corporations buy in-depth analysis of stories on particular topics over time to determine the overall effectiveness of their media relations activities.Public relations firms are often hired by corporation s to manage their relationships with the media when the organisation does not either have the resources or the interest in managing its relationships with the media on their own.Example Let us take for instance, a large global energy company who wanted to show the world how it had become more focused on the environment in the wake of the BP oil spill crisis in 2010.  As a result, the company invited reporters to look at its wind farms and hired a public relations firm to manage the visits and position the firm as a  green  company.Executives were given extensive training by the public relations firm to help them tell their story most effectively and to generate interest on the part of reporters.  Several weeks later, stories started to appear in a variety of outlets depicting the company as an environmentally aware firm. [1] "

mediation,"A mediation is a voluntary process of interactive problem-solving by which a third party facilitates the negotiation of at least two people in conflict. The third-party, known as a mediator, promotes communication between conflicting groups or individuals, helps find solutions to their respective problems and sometimes participates in the formation of a solution. Example case study Gerald is a TV producer, who has been working with a screenwriter, Jeanne, on a movie script. Their working relationship has deteriorated so much that Gerald wanted to look for a new screenwriter.  However, he had signed a contract with her for that particular production they were working on.  He wanted to avoid being taken to court for breach of contract and missing the production deadline. He went to the mediation association of the TV industry.  The secretariat of the association appointed a team of two co-mediators to intervene as impartial third-parties. At the start of the first meeting, one of the co-mediators facilitated communication between Gerald and Jeanne in order to restore the relationship and to help them understand each other s respective views of the conflict. Both of them acknowledged each other s needs, such as recognition of the screenwriter s creativity for one, and meeting deadlines and adjusting to the script format for the other.  The co-mediators helped each party to structure a possible deal. At the end of the meeting, the co-mediators summarised clearly the settlement clauses, the next steps to implement, and congratulated both parties for their achievements. The producer got his script on time within the requested format, and the screenwriter was paid immediately, while her original contribution was used in the production. [1]"

Gains caused by melt ups are usually followed quite quickly by melt downs.   melt ups in the news At the end of November 2013 there was talk of a melt up in US markets. It was said that a big year for equities and risky corporate debt was entering its closing stages but late arrivals were still pouring money in to asset classes that had already been prospering.

Memes are popular with young adults and adolescents who are largely responsible for their creation and transmission. Popular memes have included Lolcats, which basically consists of pictures of cats with funny captions. Another meme, Advice Dog, is said to have spawned many copies. Sometimes memes are based on pictures of famous people. On other occasions the memes themselves become famous, such as doge, a meme based on a Japanese Shiba Inu dog, which even has a cryptocurrency named after it: Dogecoin.   meme in the news In January 2014 a writer for FT Alphaville noted that dogecoin had an advantage over some other cryptocurrency startups in that it was based on a meme. Later in January, an FT story considered whether Satya Nadella would take the reins at Microsoft and if so in which direction he would take the company.

mentor capital,"The term mentor refers to someone who imparts wisdom to and shares knowledge with a less experienced colleague. Mentor capital refers to the body of knowledge and skills that is passed from the mentor to the colleague. The skills and knowledge are vital to business development, survival and ultimately success and have equal or possibly more value than financial capital at the nascent stage of the companies  growth and maturity. In an insanely fast-paced world of technology start-ups, mentors are one of the most critical success factors and key relationships of such ventures. Experienced serial entrepreneurs, who have been there and done that, are increasingly critical to help start-up chief executives fine-tune their strategy, define key performance indicators, interpret market results, get introductions to business partners and investors, and serve as sounding boards for the fast-paced decision-making required to start and run a business. ExampleSilicon-valley based Paul Graham co-founder of Viaweb, created the first, and most successful, formal mentor capital programme called Y-Combinator in 2005. Through a highly competitive global application process, a select group of start-ups are invited to spend 90 days in the San Francisco Bay area.  The primary goal is to get the companies in the best shape possible as they prepare to formally present and demonstrate their product on Demo Day, which is essentially a graduation ceremony and coming out party for the start-ups in front of the world s top start-up investors. Y Combinator invests a nominal amount, typically averaging about $18,000 in each start-up. More importantly, in the Y Combinator model, Graham and a group of eight colleagues, serve as full-time mentors to start-ups during their 90 day residency. In addition, there are three part-time mentors as well as two attorneys and two technical advisors, who are also available to mentor the start-ups during an unlimited number of office hours. This investment of time, referred to as  mentor capital,  is where the real value of the programme is delivered. Graham and his colleagues work intensively with the companies during the 90 day mentorship cycle. They have vast experience with their own successful start-ups as well as deep and long-standing connections to the Silicon Valley entrepreneurship and investment ecosystem. For example, each week they host an extended session with a prominent Silicon Valley founder/ entrepreneur which lasts approximately four hours and involves deep off-the-record discussion on what it took to make their company successful. The Y Combinator Mentor Capital method has created an extraordinary track record of success and has been instrumental in creating a number of category defining companies such as Dropbox, Airbnb, Reddit and Scribd.

merge,"If two or more companies, organizations etc merge, or if they are merged, they join together. [1]  "
merger,"The combination of two (or more) companies into a new or existing legal entity. There are two basic types of merger: 1) the acquisition by one company of all the shares in another, with one of the companies (not necessarily the acquirer) surviving as the legal entity; 2) a new legal entity is created to combine the assets and operations of two companies, with shareholders of both companies offered shares in that new entity. The latter type of merger is often called consolidation in the US. Mergers, but also acquisitions are often presented as ""mergers of equals"".[1]   merger in the news Comment in the FT's Lex column in December 2012 referred to research from Cass Business School that suggested real mergers of equals, involving level splits of management, the board, revenues, assets, employees and even the name, are few and far between. Of over 1,200 deals described as mergers between 1995 and 2012, only 300 met Cass s criteria for a genuine merger. "
merger Monday,"Generally, more mergers and acquisitions are announced on a Monday (typically before the stock market opens) than on any other day of the week, as the deal teams and merging companies have the entire weekend for last-minute preparations, public relations planning and other issues to finalise the deal.This confluence of announcements is therefore referred to as 'Merger Monday' and can often dominate the business news during a particularly busy merger period. [1] ExampleThe fourth Monday of April 2012 set dealmakers  hearts alight. Nestl  said it would buy Pfizer s infant nutrition business for $11.85bn. AstraZeneca informed markets it would buy Ardea Biosciences for $1.3bn. And Thomson Reuters announced the sale of its healthcare unit for $1.25bn. With more than $17bn in deals announced in a single day, observers heralded the return of  Merger Mondays , which had been common around 2008. The flurry of activity sparked hopes that companies were finally shrugging off the eurozone crisis and getting back to doing deals. But the enthusiasm was short-lived. The fourth Monday of April turned out to be an aberration and the months since have seen deal activity slow to a crawl. [2] ViewMerger Monday  deals fizzle out"
merger arbitrage,"An investment strategy simultaneously buys and sells the stocks of two merging companies. The profit is made from the spread, or difference, between a target company s share price after a takeover announcement and the closing price at completion of the deal. This is because during a takeover the stock of the acquiring company often falls while the stock of the target company rises.  So an M&A; fund might both buy shares in the company being bid for and, to limit its risk, might sell - or short - shares in the bidder. If all goes to plan and the deal goes through, the fund will have made more from the increase in the target s share price than it lost on the fall in value of the bidder.  [1]"
merger partner,A company that merges (combines) with another company. [1] 
mergers and acquisitions,"M&A; is a common short term for mergers and acquisitions, grouping the two concepts as a single area of interest. . Whether some combinations are structured as a merger or acquisition depends not only on the underlying business transaction, but also on other legal, taxation and psychological implications. An acquisition may or may not lead to a merger, from a strategic and investment banking point of view the two concepts require a similar expertise and process. M&A; activity contributes to the consolidation or rationalisation in a particular sector or industry but may be subject to antitrust concerns.[1]   mergers and acquisitions in the news US stocks were lifted in early February 2013 by the news that there had been a pick up in mergers and acquisitions. In contrast, Mike Fries, chief executive of Liberty Global, dismissed speculation that the cable group would look to buy ITV, the UK commercial broadcaster, following the acquisition of Virgin Media.  We have not thought about that at all,  he said in a conference call with journalists.  I do not anticipate any meaningful M&A; activity in the UK market for some time.

merit bonus,See performance bonus
meritocracy,"A social system that gives the greatest power and highest social positions to people with the most ability. [1] In a business context, a meritocracy is a community in which leadership is based on capability. Where people are positioned and recognised because they have the right character, skills and behaviours, not because they fit any gender or ethnic stereotype. The challenge for many joint stock corporations is the overwhelming bias towards the promotion of privilege and entitlement, driven by greed and ego. We might call this a form of corporate aristocracy and this certainly chimes with the debate around boardroom pay. A meritocratic business offers a truly diverse, engaged and inclusive workforce.  Responsibilities are based on talent, and leadership reflects a healthy balance of age, gender and ethnicity. People are hired for their character and skills. These in turn are nurtured and developed so that every colleague is well equipped to fulfil their responsibilities, ultimately leading to a more capable, effective, respected and inclusive business that attracts and retains the best customers and colleagues. The most successful businesses in the twenty-first century will not be led by a narrow aristocracy of white, middle-aged men but by a diverse and vibrant community of people that reflects our global village.

micro-credits,"Micro-credits are small loans (of a few hundred dollars) made to individuals or groups, and due for repayment after a short period of time, normally a year or less. Lending to groups (particularly of women) is a very successful model in some parts of Asia where each group provides guarantees based on the solidarity of its members. Micro-credits in general are extended for the financing of micro productive activities such as farming, commerce, handicrafts, food, and so on. There is minimal red tape when extending micro-credits and processing steps are quick and friendly. Administratively, however, micro-credits are labour-intensive; they can be geographically scattered over large areas and monitoring and recovery costs represent a large component of the interest charged by the micro-lenders. Lending rates vary between about 40 per cent and 100 per cent annually, depending on how they are presented. The great success of micro-credits as financial tools of empowerment for many at the bottom of the pyramic (BOP) is underpinned by a very low level of losses. Equally significant is the fact that formal micro-lenders are in many countries subject to some form of formal government or financial consumer regulation, providing assurance that micro-clients will be treated with fairness and consideration. These, in turn, place great value in their relationship with established micro-lenders since otherwise their source for credit would be informal street ""curb"" money lenders  or loan sharks, who charge usurious day-lending rates. [1]      "
micro-insurance,"People at the bottom of the pyramid (BOP) are exposed to many of the same risks to their existence than others in the upper parts of the pyramid. An unusually severe monsoon or hurricane season may affect both segments equally badly for example. The difference is that those in the upper segments are usually better prepared to deal with their aftermath by relying on weather or flood insurance. While availability of insurance to BOP was unheard of just some years ago, its has proved to be a viable business that benefits the buyer as well as the seller of insurance protection. For example, in some parts of India where an excess of rain can ruin the livelihood of small farmers, progressive, social-oriented private micro-insurers have been successful in developing weather-insurance products that these farmers have found attractive and affordable. It was not easy to overcome the initial resistance of farmers, who had had previous bad experiences with government-sponsored programs. But, with the help from well established Indian insurance companies acting as re-insurers plus the support from the multilateral financial community, an initial pilot program for offering reliable weather micro-insurance to farmers for specific crops has been thriving, with both farmers and insurers mutually benefiting. The business continues to grow as an increasing number of small farmers demand weather insurance to protect their livelihoods. Experimental offering of micro-insurance for certain types of health coverage and burial expenses are being explored. The creativity of these initiatives attests to the undeniable interest of large-scale businesses to addressing the needs of the  invisible unserved  markets.

microblog,"A microblog is a blogging platform where the amount of information that can be shared per author is either enforced to be very short, or just typically very short. Example The most common examples of microblogs are Twitter and Tumblr. Twitter limits users  posts   called  tweets  - to 140 characters. Twitter s limit is set such that a standard text message, which is limited at 160 characters, can include one entire tweet plus address information.  Tumblr has no character limit, but users typically adhere to an  unspoken rule  that shorter is better for posts; many tumblog - the term to describe a public tumblr profile - entries contain only a photo and a brief caption. The very brief nature of microblogs makes these easy to scale.  This means that hundreds of millions of individuals can post billions of status updates per day. According to Twitter, in May of 2011, Twitter was handling 2,200 updates per second, and had 175 million users, but requires far less computational power to maintain than a full-scale blogging website or content management system would require.

Lending institutions   non-governmental organisations, local co-operatives and banks   found lending to these people was good, repeat business. Moreover, MFIs helped to improve standards of living, transforming and empowering marginalised groups, particularly women, in some of the worst slums and ghettoes in developing markets.By 2006 it was estimated 90m people were borrowing from microfinance institutions (MFIs) to fund cottage industries and embryonic businesses.

mindfulness,"A mindful leader is conscious of the interests of the company's stakeholders, has a deep understanding of the business and is able to create a vision for success in the dynamic and uncertain business environment. Mindfulness is an awareness of the key stakeholders and the markets that govern the relationships with them. The mindful manager understands how customers use the company's products and services to help achieve their objectives and how competitive alternatives compare. The goal in this relationship is to provide value for customers by offering the most desirable combination of product and service attributes. For employees, the mindful manager appreciates the decision process that causes the best employees to choose to work for that company rather than for another. Competitiveness in these labour markets means offering a package of employment attributes that attract the employees required to achieve success. For investors, the manager is aware of the returns available in the market on similar-risk investments and strives to achieve a better result for them. The mindful manager is aware that the dynamics of each market ensures that none of these relationships is static and that a key responsibility is to manage these changes to the benefit of the key stakeholders. Mindfulness is also having a deep understanding of the relevant past performance, current capabilities and future prospects of a business.  Knowing the past provides a rich experience base from which to draw insight that may be helpful in assessing the future.  Knowing the present allows an assessment of the resources available to meet future opportunities.  The future cannot be known, but the mindful manager is aware of the responsibility to create expectations about the future that provide guidance for current activities and decisions. It is these expectations that comprise a vision of how the firm will participate and succeed in the future. Finally, mindfulness is to be aware that while the manager has responsibility for creating expectations about the unknown future, for managing the dynamic relationships with all stakeholders, and for understanding the complexity of the firm and its myriad of activities, that these things cannot be known with certainty.   Change cannot be fully understood in advance, and mindfulness requires ongoing scrutiny and refinement of expectations and actions based on newer experiences and information. [1]"

mobile internet,"Rapid advances in mobile technologies now allow consumers to interact, create, and share content on the internet regardless of their physical location. This kind of ubiquitous access to the internet through a mobile device is known as mobile internet. Dramatic growth in mobile activities has led to a corresponding torrent of granular data that capture these behaviours. Besides smart phones, increasingly tablet computers and intermediate mobile devices like iPads enable access to the mobile internet. There are a few aspects of mobile internet that distinguish it from other types of internet access (via PCs or laptops). Firstly, in many countries, users incur explicit expenses (for example, by paying usage-based data transmission charges) based on the number of bytes uploaded or downloaded. This feature is in contrast to using PCs where the internet can be accessed using a fixed connection or a WiFi connection without incurring any costs based on usage. Second, users can access the internet via mobile devices anytime and anywhere, subject to signal reception. In contrast, PCs render stricter limitations on geographical mobility and access. Third, screen sizes tend to be smaller on mobile devices compared to PCs, thereby rendering higher search costs for mobile devices. Increasingly, companies are also enabling access to their mobile internet via mobile apps that can be downloaded for free by consumers. For a given website, while the content is typically the same between fixed and mobile web, there are changes in layout and design. [1]"

monetary policy,"The decisions a monetary authority makes to manage the money supply. The tools at its disposal include modifying benchmark interest rates (such as the Fed funds target and the discount rate in the US), conducting money market operations (which influence short-term interest rates), and changing banks' reserve requirements. Depending on whether the authority wishes to expand money supply, keep it steady or reduce it, monetary policy can be described as accommodative (or loose), neutral or tight."
monetary policy committee (MPC),"In 1997, the UK Treasury granted the Bank of England operational independence over the conduct of monetary policy. Politicians have a poor track record of maintaining the purchasing power of money, because they have an incentive to use inflation for political objectives. One way to credibly commit to a low inflation environment is to relinquish some control to a panel of independent experts. The monetary policy committee (MPC) is chaired by the Governor of the Bank of England and is comprised of four other members of the Bank, and four external members. Their main objective is to ensure low and stable inflation (consistent with a target rate set by the Treasury) and to maintain confidence in pound sterling. The traditional tool to do this is the Bank rate of interest   the rate that they charge commercial banks to borrow money. When this is at its lower bound there are a number of other tools that the MPC can use, for example, quantitative easing. Whilst most economists agree that inflation is the result of the money supply being too high, they differ in how true this is over the short term. Inflation  hawks  tend to place an emphasis on lower inflation above all other considerations, while  doves  are more likely to tolerate a looser monetary stance. [1] Video Bank of England split "

monetary transmission,"Monetary transmission refers to the process by which a central bank s monetary policy decisions are passed on, through financial markets, to businesses and households. Since the financial crisis, borrowers around the world have not always felt the full benefit of central banks  ultra low interest rates because of the poor health of banks on the high street. ExampleIn 2012, the problem has been particularly pronounced in the eurozone periphery, where businesses and households in countries such as Italy and Spain face dramatically higher borrowing costs than the ECB s main interest rate of 0.75 per cent because their countries are so exposed to the eurozone crisis. Borrowers in the periphery pay far more than their counterparts in  core  euro-area states, such as Germany. Eurozone policy makers are concerned that this could stoke opposition to the single currency in the bloc s periphery. [1] ViewQ&A; on revamped ECB bond-buying processEurozone: Convergence in reverse"
monetisation,"Monetisation refers to the conversion of an object into money, which means that it is generally accepted as a medium of exchange. Metals are monetised as coins once they are standardised in weight and accepted as money. Government debt can also be monetised, which occurs when a government replaces its interest-bearing debt with money. ExampleHere is how the process of debt monetisation works. When a government spends in excess of its tax revenue it must borrow from the public. The public purchases this debt because it pays an attractive interest rate. If the government has a significant amount of debt outstanding, it may choose to purchase its own debt with newly printed currency. The government has thereby replaced its interest-bearing debt with money, and has thus monetised part of its debt. Inflation is an unfortunate consequence of debt monetisation. The public was willing to hold the government s debt as part of its investment portfolio because the debt paid an attractive interest rate, but the same is not true for the newly printed money. A consequence of purchasing debt with money is that now the supply of money exceeds its demand. An attempt to purchase goods and assets with this excess money supply will drive up prices, thus generating inflation. Indeed, debt monetisation to finance a deficit is referred to as inflationary financing of the deficit. [1]"

mooc,"Mooc is an acronym for  massive open online course . It refers to a web-based class designed to support a large number of participants. Typically, students enrolled in a Mooc watch video lectures   often sliced into digestible 10 or 15-minute segments   and interact with instructors and fellow participants in online forums. Some moocs require students to take online tests or quizzes with multiple choice answers that can be graded automatically, while others require students to complete peer-reviewed assignments. Some moocs use a combination of these assessments. A key advantage of moocs over traditional classroom-based learning is their convenience. Moocs offer a self-determined pace of learning so that students may study according to their own schedules (although some do have start and completion dates). This also gives students the opportunity to re-watch parts of the lecture that is more challenging for them. A number of web-based platforms backed by top universities and colleges offer moocs in a wide range of subjects; the content of a Mooc is often similar to that of a university or graduate-level course. A selection of current courses can be seen at the FT's Mooc tracker. Coursera, an online learning system launched by Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, two Stanford computer scientists, delivers Moocs in maths, science and the humanities. Udacity, another online education company, started by Sebastian Thrun, a former Stanford professor, primarily offers Moocs in computer programming and software design. Harvard and MIT s edX, a non-profit, joint online education partnership, delivers Moocs in computer science, health research and chemistry. These platforms do not offer academic credit to students who complete a Mooc, however students may receive electronic certificates of accomplishment. Some platforms give students the option of taking a proctored final exam. Moocs make high-quality education accessible to the masses, but some are sceptical about whether these online platforms can maintain rigorous standards online. There are also questions around whether these platforms  business models are sustainable given that for now, moocs are free. ExampleKevin Werbach, a professor of legal studies at the Wharton school at the University of Pennsylvania, taught a Mooc on Coursera beginning in August of 2012. His Mooc, which lasted six weeks, was about gamification   the application of game elements and digital game design techniques to non-game problems, such as business and social impact challenges. It was one of the first business courses offered on the platform. A total of 81,631 signed up for the class and 9,244 took the final exam. [1]   Moocs in the news In November 2013, a report looked at a movement in Europe to transform Moocs from academic novelty courses to meaningful qualifications. A Berlin-based platform, Iversity, argued that should credits be awarded they could be transferred to another course through the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System. But also in November 2013, another report argued that the cult of the Moocs had taken a blow after Sebastian Thrun, founder of Udacity described Moocs as a ""lousy product"".                  "

Talk of HP's better outlook coincided with the company's announcement of Moonshot a data centre server that consumed up to 89 per cent less energy, 94 per cent less space and cost 63 per cent less than a traditional server. In June 2013, a report on Google's rising dominance also considered its ability to turn ideas into products. This was evidenced most clearly through Google X, its moonshot research lab which was developing wearable computers and automomous cars."
moral hazard,"In insurance, the chance that the insured will be more careless and take greater risks because he or she is protected, thus increasing the potential of claims on the provider. The concept can be extended to any contract (such as a loan from the IMF to a country in financial crisis) that by its existence could prompt a signatory to take unnecessary risks. [1]  Moral hazard arises when a contract or financial arrangement creates incentives for the parties involved to behave against the interest of others. Example There are concerns that some individuals that take out large insurance policies to cover specific risks are likely to claim against such policies. There are also concerns that some borrowers that take on loans at very high interest rates are likely to have incentives to default. Insurance firms and banks use screening techniques to try and identify such customers and monitor their behaviour. Moral hazard occurs once a contract or financial arrangement has been agreed upon.

mudaraba,"In Islamic finance, mudaraba is a trust financing contract. Mudaraba may be conducted between investment account holders as fund providers and the Islamic bank as a mudarib. It may also be conducted between the Islamic bank, as fund provider, on behalf of itself or on behalf of investment account holders, and business owners and other craftsmen or traders etc. Mudaraba is a partnership where capital is provided, in cash or assets (no debt is accepted) by one party - the fund provider - and labour is provided by the other party - mudarib. Both parties can appoint agents on their behalf.  A mudaraba contract could be terminated unilaterally except when a term has been agreed by both parties, in which case the mudaraba could only be prematurely terminated by mutual agreement.  In addition, if the mudarib has already started the business, in the mudaraba contract, it becomes binding until actual or constructive liquidation.  As mudaraba is a trust-based contracts, the mudarib is not liable for losses except in case of breach of the requirements of trust or misconduct. Guarantees against negligence or misconduct could be taken from the mudarib as long as they are not excessively used by the capital provider.  The contract should specify whether the mudaraba instrument is unrestricted or restricted (to specific location or type of investment as agreed between parties).  It should also indicate the distribution ratio of profit between both parties (which cannot be a lump sum or a percentage of capital).  The distribution ratio could be revised at future dates by agreement of both parties. [1] [2] [3]"

multi-family offices,"The world s wealthiest individuals and families have a broad spectrum of investment specialists offering them advice and services including private banks, wealth management firms, tax advisors, hedge funds, investment companies and so on. No institution can be best at offering advice in all investment areas, especially given the explosion and complexity of products and services available. As such, the super wealthy have family offices   professional investment firms owned by themselves that mange their own wealth. Often the family office is manned by a small number of professionals that both manage their wealth and shop around to get the best deals from a range of private banking/ wealth management providers. A multi-family office is where a group of wealthy families get together to undertake such activity. While industry estimates vary, the general consensus is that families have to have at least $30million to $50 million of investible assets to make the set up of a family office economically viable. ExampleSome multi-family offices actively seek to attract new family clients and even the largest private banks   such as UBS, Credit Suisse and Pictet & Cie   have family office operations   offering bespoke investment and related services to their top family clients.

multi-manager fund,Fund that invests in a range of other funds controlled by different asset managers. The aim is to diversify risk and the potential returns. Some multi-manager funds allow the customer to choose a selection of funds to be invested in and others make the decisions themselves.
multi-market competition,"Multi-market competition is an economic situation where two or more firms are in competition against each other at the same time and in different markets (products or places). When these firms are in contact several times and in several places, this multi-market competition can lead to a particular phenomenon called  mutual forbearance . Mutual forbearance is a reduction of the intensity of the competition through familiarity and deterrence. Trying to avoid a price war, competitors, particularly if they have asymmetric positions, can have interests to slow down their commercial behavior on each others market. Example Famous situations of multi-market competition are known particularly in the airline industry and in the hotel industry. Hubs or domestic markets are in these cases considered as centres of their sphere of influence. On selected lines or offers, multimarket contacts bring high prices or higher profits. The construction of the European electricity and gas market has also lead to the development of a multimarket competition. The rapid development of European position for the former national monopolies set up multimarket contacts between EDF, ENEL, and Endesa in France, Italy, and Spain. It stopped with the takeover of Endesa by Enel, in 2007. [1]"

multiple criteria decision analysis,"Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is an advanced field of operations research and management science, devoted to the development of decision support tools methodologies to address complex decision problems involving multiple criteria goals or objectives of conflicting nature.  The development of multi criteria decision analysis can be traced back to the 18th century works on social choice theory by the Marquis de Condorcet and Jean-Charles de Borda. At the end of the 19th century, Vilfredo Pareto s work on the concept of efficiency also became a reference. Modern MCDA is founded on work carried out in the 1940s by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern on expected utility theory and on Bernard Roy s work on outranking relations which dates from the 1960s. Current multi criteria decision analysis research focuses on behavioural aspects of decision making, problem structuring procedures, methodologies for optimisation under multiple objectives, multi attribute utility/value theory, outranking decision models, and preference disaggregation techniques for inferring decision models from data. Multi criteria decision analysis is concerned with a variety of different types of decision problems, including deterministic problems, decision making under uncertainty and fuzziness, dynamic problems and group decisions. Over the years multi criteria decision analysis has developed strong links with other quantitative disciplines such as computer science, artificial intelligence and evolutionary computation. MCDA introduces sound procedures for problem structuring and criteria aggregation, which can be used to rank and classify a set of alternative options or to choose the best ones. Except for the normative and descriptive aspects of decision-making, MCDA also adds a constructive perspective, in which a decision model is built through a progressive learning process that enhances the decision maker s understanding of the problem and ultimately facilitates the construction of a good model. Thus, a decision model is interactively constructed with the active participation of the decision-makers, taking into account their system of values and judgment policy as well as their expertise on the particular problem under consideration. Multi criteria decision analysis has been used in a wide variety of fields such as energy management, environmental planning, public services, healthcare, transportation, logistics, marketing, human resources management, and finance. Multi criteria decision analysis approaches have been widely used by public entities, firms, and organisations, such as the European Commission and the UK Department of Department for Communities and Local Government). The research and practice in the area of MCDA is supported by the International Society on Multiple Criteria Decision Making, the EURO Working Group Multicriteria Decision Aiding, and several laboratories in universities all over the world (LAMSADE - Universit  Paris Dauphine, France, Laboratory of Intelligent Decision Support Systems - Poznan University of Technology, Poland,  Financial Engineering Laboratory - Technical University of Crete, Greece, etc.)[1]"

murabaha,"In Islamic finance, a sales contract where the bank buys a product on behalf of a client and resells the product to the same client by clearly mentioning the cost incurred in buying the product and the margin or the mark-up when reselling the product to the client. Usually the bank pays for the product in full and allows the client to pay the bank back in installments. So, instead of having a classic loan as in conventional finance when the bank lends money to the client to buy products, in the murabaha case, the financial institution buys and resells the product with a mark-up to the client. Murabaha is a very popular contract in Islamic finance, especially for the buying of commodities involving large sums of money where the client is unable to pay in advance or when the commodities supplier does not trust the client. It is Shariah-compliant because there is no interest rate on a differed payment the financial institution gives to the client. Since the mark-up is fixed, banks are more comfortable in entering the murabaha arrangement than in profit and loss sharing options where the income for the bank is not guaranteed. [1]"
musharaka,"Musharaka (partnership) is one of the financing contracts used by Islamic banks.  A Musharaka contract is an agreement where two or more parties (for example an Islamic bank and its clients) agree to contribute to the capital - in cash or in kind, no debt is accepted - of the partnership in equal or varying amounts to establish a new project or share in an existing one. Musharaka could be constant, where the partners  shares in the capital remain constant throughout the period as specified in the musharaka contract or diminishing, where the Islamic bank agrees to transfer its share gradually to the other partner, so that the Islamic bank s share diminishes and the other partner s share increases until the latter becomes the sole proprietor of the venture. In musharaka contracts, all parties must provide work but equality of the share of work is not a requirement. Partners may appoint workers to perform the tasks that are not within their individual share of work and the cost will be charged to the partnership.  Partners are not allowed to borrow or lend money from the partnership s funds except after securing agreement from the other partners.  Musharaka partners must share profit and loss. For musharaka contracts to be valid, they must specify, at the time of the contract, the share of each partner in the capital.  The latter must also be available at the time of contract.  The Islamic bank's share in the musharaka shall be measured at fair value at the time of contract and at historical cost, after contracting, at the end of each financial period until final settlement. For musharaka financing transactions that continue for more than one financial period, the Islamic bank shall recognise its share of profits or losses, for a financial period, resulting from partial or final settlement of the Musharaka.

mutual agreement procedure,"A mutual agreement procedure (Map) is a feature in many double taxation agreements. A Map allows a taxpayer which considers that it is being taxed in a way that is not in accordance with the terms of the treaty, as a result of the actions of one (or both) of the relevant tax authorities, to present its case to the tax authority in the country in which it is resident. The tax authority has the power to consider the issue, and give relief to resolve the matter, without a requirement to contact the other tax authority. If the case cannot be resolved in this way, both states can consult to try to resolve the case by mutual agreement. Note that a Map does not guarantee the elimination of any double taxation, rather it endeavours to do so. [1]"

Mutual funds are called unit trusts in the UK."
mutual fund A-shares,"Some U.S. mutual funds offer several different classes of shares of the same fund. Each class has the same investment objective and the money invested in all of the share classes is pooled together. However, each class maintains different fees and shareholder servicing agreements. A-Shares contain a front-end sales load, which is a fee expressed as a percentage, paid by investors at the point of sale. It is deducted from the initial amount an investor puts into the funds. Traditionally, funds have given discounts on the sales load for larger purchases: the larger the investment, the lower the load. [1]"
mutual fund B-shares,"Some U.S. mutual funds offer several different classes of shares of the same fund. Each class has the same investment objective and the money invested in all of the share classes is pooled together. However, each class maintains different fees and shareholder servicing agreements. B-shares, which are being phased-out by many fund shops, charge higher annual expenses than A-shares and also include surrender charges, which are paid when an investor redeems his/her shares within a defined period of time. When the time-period for potential surrender charges ends, B-shares typically convert to A-shares. [1]"
mutual fund I-shares,"Some U.S. mutual funds offer several different classes of shares of the same fund.

When the customer's bid for a room exceeded the undisclosed price on priceline.com, the transaction could be completed. Priceline.com earned the difference between the price the customer named and the price charged by the hotel. Apart from this, web auctions and name-your-own-price systems are also offered by some restaurants. So a person who has lunch in a restaurant has the possibility of deciding how much s/he is willing to pay for the meal consumed.  A restaurant in London reported it has observed rising revenues due to this concept, as customers usually paid more than they would have been charged. [1]"

narrow framing,"In finance, an investor is said to suffer from narrow framing if he seems to make investment decisions without considering the context of his total portfolio.  Framing  refers to the context in which a decision is made, or the context in which a decision is placed in order to influence that decision. For example, a gambler might readily spend $500 won at the casino on an expensive meal, reasoning that the $500 is  free  money, while he would not be willing to spend $500 of earnings from his job on such a meal. Similarly, a merchant can mark a product as priced at $100 dollars but on sale for only $60 dollars to foster the impression that the product is a bargain at $60. Thus, the context in which the decision maker sets his decision affects the outcome, and others can attempt to manipulate that context for their own benefit. A narrow-framing investor may ignore and, therefore, squander the potential benefits of diversification given his myopic approach to decision making.   These investors may also be subject to marketing pitches regarding specific, seemingly attractive investments. Academic researchers measure an individual s degree of narrow framing with trade clustering.  That is, if an investor trades an individual stock now and then, he may be guilty of narrow framing. This contrasts with investors who trade several or many assets at the same time, as if they recognize that they are rearranging a portfolio of assets. Research shows that individuals identified as narrow framers also make other mistakes with their portfolios and typically experience relatively poor portfolio performance. Example An investor may get excited about the shares of a particular tech stock and purchase that stock without recognizing that his portfolio is already overweight in tech stocks.  An analogy would be buying a new car without considering whether it fits in the garage, whether it is large enough to carry the entire family, or whether its fuel efficiency is appropriate for the buyer s income.

national insurance,"In addition to income tax, the self employed may be liable to pay, and employees may suffer deduction of, national insurance contributions (NIC). For employees these are payable where earnings exceed a weekly earnings threshold.Earnings at or below the threshold do not attract a contribution liability, and contributions above the threshold are charged up to an upper limit, with a further (but lower) charge applying to all earnings above the upper limit. Prior to 6 April 2016, if the employee was contracted out of the state earnings-related pension scheme a reduced rate was applicable on earnings below the upper earnings limit. Employers also pay national insurance contributions on the earnings of their employees, above the earnings threshold. Prior to April 2016 there was a lower employers' rate where the employee was contracted out. From April 2014 there has been an allowance of  2,000 per year for all businesses and charities to be offset against their employer s NICs bill. The allowance is claimed as part of the normal payroll process through real time information (RTI). There are different rates for contributions for the self-employed. The Government is considering the potential integration of the operation of PAYE and NICs. [1]   national insurance in the news George Osborne, the chancellor, said in his UK Budget 2015 announcement, that he would scrap class 2 national insurance contributions in the next parliament   a charge of  2.75 a week for self-employed workers whose profits are more than  5,885 a year. The move will save self-employed people  143 a year. Higher earners will still have to pay class 4 national insurance contributions, which are levied at 9 per cent of profits between  7,956 and  41,865 and 2 per cent on profits over  41,865. The chancellor s decision reflects the growing economic significance of the self-employed, whose ranks have swelled in the years since the crisis to 4.5m, or about 15 per cent of the workforce.

near field communication,"Near field communication (NFC) refers to a short-range wireless communication technology using radio frequency waves. The technology is designed to enable communication or information to be exchanged between devices separated by a few centimetres. Example It is possible to carry out transactions and processes electronically, previously conducted face-to-face, such as checking identities and making payments using mobile phones.  Take for example, Japan s mobile-based subway tickets in which passengers tap their mobile device on an NFC receiver to enter the subway platform. [1] NFC is already included in many handsets and enables some useful features, such as mobile phone boarding passes for airplanes and phone-to-phone file sharing. NFC is perhaps best known as the technology of choice for mobile payments. With its limited geographical range, high frequency and good security, many see it as the technology that will make a reality of the dream of the  mobile-phone wallet  - a smartphone that works like a credit card, debit card or even cash.

[1]Most bonds rise in value when interest rates fall, so that the yield they offer remains in line with the lower market rates.But with mortgage-backed securities, a fall in interest rates brings the risk that borrowers will repay their loans to refinance at a lower rate.As such, the value of these securities tends to drop when interest rates fall, a characteristic that is known as  negative convexity .In 2007, Colm Kelleher, chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley, said this was one reason why its bet on the subprime market went so badly wrong.

negative equity,"A borrower is said to be in negative equity when the outstanding value of an asset is less than the loan taken out to buy it. The term negative equity is frequently used to describe the housing market when a downturn in the market can result in the value of a mortgage being more than the new depressed value of the property. In the US, borrowers in negative equity are often referred to as being ""underwater"".   negative equity in the news After the 2007 US subprime mortgage crisis (that precipitated the global financial crisis of 2008-2009) many home borrowers were plunged into negative equity. Banks and other mortgage lenders had been taking advantage of cheap money and lending to people who were very unlikely to be able to repay the loan. When the housing bubble burst many borrowers found themselves in negative equity. As the financial crisis took hold and banks became reluctant to lend, housing prices in many developed countries fell and the problem of negative equity spread. In February 2013 it was reported that four in 10 of the buyers who ventured into the UK housing market after the start of 2007 and subsequently resold their properties did so at a loss. Meanwhile, in January 2013 US house prices remained 29 per cent below their 2006 peak and 10.9m US homeowners, representing 26 per cent of all homes with an outstanding mortgage, were seriously underwater (or in negative equity) according to a housing data provider contacted by the FT in February 2013.

negomania,"Negomania is a tendency to believe that all problems can be solved through negotiations, without checking first if negotiations are the best way of reaching the best solution. ExampleIt is Friday morning, the work that needs to be done today is nowhere near completion.  You come up with a plan - if you and your team work overtime today, and a few work on Saturday, you are convinced that this would solve the problem. You summon a meeting to find volunteers to work on Saturday and to negotiate with everyone on how to allocate the work. This meeting lasts for hours with colleagues arguing and with most of them not agreeing with your plan and the idea of working on Saturday. What if you had spent time at the beginning of the day carrying out a cost-benefit analysis of negotiating and asking yourself the right questions first.  Is this problem worth negotiating  Will negotiations help me solve my problem  If part of the problem must be negotiated, who should be part of the talks  Do I need a facilitator to help me   If negotiations fail, what should be my plan B  Will negotiations deliver a better deal than plan B  [1]"

negotiation,"Official discussions between groups who are trying to reach an agreement. [1]  In the context of deal-making or dispute resolution, a negotiation involves a joint process of interactive problem-solving between at least two people who are facing challenging or conflicting requests from each other.  Each person has a problem that the other may be able to solve.  They attempt to resolve their problems together, with the objective of reaching an agreeable solution, while at the same time preserving or building their relationship. Example case studyTake Mary who is head of purchasing and is responsible for managing 96 suppliers. Management made the decision to reduce the number of suppliers by half, and it was her responsibility to make that happen. Many suppliers were less than effective and a high number of them were creating a lot of transaction costs.  However, most suppliers had a multi-year contract that her company was bound to, leading to a risk of a costly lawsuit for breach of contract, especially if  fired-to-be  suppliers united and litigated. Mary therefore decided to discreetly renegotiate some contracts.For instance, she convinced many suppliers with overlapping activities to merge, and this way she could already reduce the number of suppliers by 30%.She also approached suppliers, who were close to retirement, and suggested they should sell their businesses to other colleagues, while she helped the latter to get bank loans. That covered 10% of suppliers.For an extra 8%, she negotiated severance packages, with a one-year transition period. At the end, her negotiation campaign worked for 46 suppliers.Finally, she was left with only two suppliers filing a lawsuit for breach of contract. She settled with one of them before the court reached a decision, and she lost the remaining case with limited damages to pay. This negotiation process, coupled with creative outcomes, saved her a lot of money, compared to litigation. [2] "

net neutrality,"Net neutrality refers to the principle that all traffic on the internet should be treated equally. The internet is delivered by broadband providers who can use their infrastructure to set particular terms for access of internet applications and content (websites, services, protocols). These access terms are discussed under the heading of ""net neutrality"" (NN), generating a debate that has received a great deal of attention from all the stakeholders involved and which is likely to influence the development of the sector in the years to come. On one side of this debate side stand the ""openists , who propose a regulation that bans discrimination of data packets (eg, Google s content should be treated identically to that of any other content provider) and guarantees open and equal access to the net. One of their main arguments is that net neutrality is needed to protect the innovation of small start up content providers: among those there may be tomorrow s giants like Google, Facebook or YouTube. Innovation at the edge of the network is one of the defining features of the internet and discrimination constitutes a potential harm to it. On the other side stand the  deregulationists , who believe that the internet needs no regulation and will develop better by letting the market forces operate freely. Their main argument is based on the need of broadband providers to get an appropriate remuneration for the use of the infrastructure, which seems the best way to guarantee investment for maintenance and expansion of the capacity of the network (the  core  of the internet). The latter is a prominent concern in times where the popularity of bandwidth-intensive applications is rapidly increasing. Example As consumers, we typically subscribe to a broadband provider (say, BT) in order to use the internet (say, search on Google). The funding to BT s infrastructure comes from us, not from Google. Yet Google gets its revenues from advertising. BT treats all content providers, such as Google, identically, so no one gets a faster priority lane to deliver their content   this is net neutrality. Technology is now changing this picture, especially if net neutrality is to be abandoned. Broadband allows BT to engage in web traffic management techniques that can potentially be used for discrimination of data packets (so, Google gets priority, but only if it pays for it), and several other practices that may raise competitive concerns (BT could promote its own content, and not that of rivals). [1] Current business models might change following a court case (see news below) ruling against net neutrality. ViewThe internet: Command and control Telecoms face EU  war of attrition    Net neutrality in the news In January 2014, a US court ruled that the Federal Communications Commission had over-reached its powers in imposing net neutrality rules on internet service providers. The ruling meant internet service providers would be able to offer companies different rates for different delivery speeds, or for different quantities.

net present value,"One way of calculating the potential return from an investment. This is basically the current value of the investment plus the present value of future cash flows, minus the initial cost of the investment plus the present value of any future costs. Present value is calculated by applying an appropriate discount rate to the expected future returns and costs. The discount rate used is the investment's cost of capital, and normally equates to the required rate of return. If NPV is positive, this implies that the expected return is higher than the required return, and one should proceed with the investment."

network analysis,Another name for critical path analysis. [1] 
network effect,"A network effect (also known as a network externality) exists when a product s value to the user increases as the number of users of the product grows. The classic example is the telephone. The more people own telephones, the more valuable the telephone network is to each owner. If there are N owners, each one of them can call the other N - 1 owners: a total of N(N-1) communications can be made. Thus the network s value grows with the number of possible connections, in the order of N squared. This insight is the basis of Metcalfe s law that states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of members within the network. When you buy a DVD player and some DVDs, you encourage an industry, and thus more DVDs are put on the market. In fact, the concept can easily extend: perhaps the most dominant network effect is language. If you write a web page in Inuktitut, not many people can read it. If your only audience is that community, that is fine. But if you want to get attention, you will probably write it in English: scientific journals, for example, are now overwhelmingly in English, especially because the internet amplifies network effects. Network effects have fundamental importance for business strategy, intellectual property, and technical change in a wide range of industries. For instance, it becomes very important to establish early on in a market. [1] Example Amazon lost money for years establishing itself as the main source for online books, in direct competition to Barnes & Noble and eventually driving Borders out of the market. Over time, positive network effects made the network more valuable and the business more succesful."

neutral bias,An indication from the US Federal Reserve that it is inclined to leave monetary conditions unchanged for the time being.
neutral rate of interest,"The neutral (or natural) rate of interest is the rate at which real GDP is growing at its trend rate, and inflation is stable. It is attributed to Swedish economist Knut Wicksell, and forms an important part of the Austrian theory of the business cycle. The neutral rate provides an important benchmark for policymakers to compare with the market rate. When interest rates are neutral the economy is on a sustainable path, and it is deviations from neutrality that cause booms and busts. For example if the market rate is pushed artificially below the neutral rate (for example through monetary expansion) then people receive a false signal to invest in more interest-sensitive projects. It is by separating interest rates from their market clearing level that central banks have the potential to create monetary instability. Because the neutral rate is a hypothetical construct we cannot observe it. Economists tend to believe that it is around 5 per cent, although Morgan Stanley estimates that it is currently under 3 per cent. [1] Article Do not overlook natural interest rates "

news feed,"News feed is a term that used to refer to a continuous feed of news stories delivered to paying subscribers who might be paying for tailored service from a news agency, such as Reuters. As the power and reach of the internet has grown, so has the use of RSS feeds and aggregation services, allowing users to set up their own news feeds that are on topics that interest them. These sorts of services are usually free. Increasingly, however, news feed is a term used to describe the continuous flow of updates from friends and contacts that display on a user's home page of a social network, such as Facebook or LinkedIn.   news feed in the news In March 2013, Facebook announced a redesign of its news feed. Under the redesign an algorithm, which selects what Facebook believes will be the most interesting to the Facebook user, will continue to function as before, despite criticisms from some users who say they sometimes miss updates from friends. However, users will now also have access to separate feeds where they can look at chronological listings of posts from their friends as well as businesses and celebrities they follow, and photos and music discussed on Facebook."

nifty fifty,"The Nifty Fifty was a group of US companies, including IBM, Coca-Cola and General Electric, that became popular among investor during the 1970s because of their perceived superior earnings growth. At that time, investors began to look not only for income from dividends, but for companies that looked likely to grow their earnings rapidly as well. A focus on yield as the primary metric for valuing companies gave way to an increasing emphasis on the price/earnings (p/e) ratios.  Investors enthusiastically bought shares in the nifty fifty and their p/e ratios climbed steeply. Their prices collapsed in the 1974/5 bear market, after which investors became more focused on smaller companies for growth. In modern times, the term Nifty Fifty describes the large Indian companies listed on the National Stock Exchange. A formal index has been launched to track their price movements.   Nifty Fifty in the news The Indian Nifty Fifty aside, most commentators agree that there is no strict equivalent to the Nifty Fifty for global investors. However, in January 2013, many stocks analysts wondered if the massive international defensive stocks might be a modern day version of the Nifty Fifty and might be similarly overvalued. However, research by Jeremy Siegel, a professor at the Wharton School of Business, found that not all Nifty Fifty stocks turned out to be ""dogs"" in the long run.  Xerox s performance warranted a price/earnings ratio of 18 rather than 46. But Coca-Cola was so successful it would have been worth paying 92 times its 1972 earnings. But as FT columnist Merryn Somerset Webb warned in September 2012, investors only need to look at the example of the Nifty Fifty to realise that you can extrapolate away, but nothing lasts forever."

NDFs are used in circumstances where there is low liquidity. such as to hedge local currency risks in emerging markets where local currencies are not freely convertible, or when there are restrictions on capital flows. Under these conditions an NDF market could develop in an offshore financial centre and contracts would typicially be settled in major foreign currencies. NDFs are traded over the counter (OTC).   non-deliverable forwards NDFs in the news In March 2013 the FT reported on two lawsuits filed against UBS. The lawsuits claimed wrongful dismissal. The two individuals who filed the suits claimed they were fired to cover up any role the bank had in allegedly manipulating the pricing of foreign exchange derivatives. The FT revealed that Singapore had become a significant location for the trade of Asian currency NDFs. Because no physical delivery of currency occurs, counterparties were taking a ""fixing rate"" set daily by a panel of banks in Singapore.

This can include loans made to households in the form of mortgages, or amounts owed on credit cards. It can also include bank loans to corporations, or corporate bonds they have issued to raise money. Economic forecasters might focus on the whole number or split it into non-financial household debt and non-financial corporate debt which can tell them different things about the health of an economy. Despite the impact of the financial crisis which was supposed to trigger deleveraging, some economists believe developed world nations are still trapped in a debt supercycle.   Non-financial debt in the news In February 2013 an FT writer observed that in December 2008, total non-financial debt in the US stood at $34.4tn. While by the end of September 2012 (four years into the financial crisis), it exceeded $39tn.

It can also be driven by social pressure, media and education.

odd lot,"A parcel of shares or bonds for trade that is smaller than the standard lot for that particular security.   odd lots in the news Following the financial crisis, higher capital costs and regulatory scrutiny forced Wall Street banks to sharply reduce their presence in the corporate bond market.

off balance sheet financing,"Financing that does not appear on a company's balance sheet because it is not strictly debt (so liabilities and associated assets are excluded from the balance sheet). In certain circumstances this can have a flattering effect on important accounting ratios such as leverage and return on assets. Accordingly, published financial statements may fail to provide a full and transparent representation of the underlying activity of the reporting entity; in particular, reported results may suggest less exposure to liabilities than really exists. Common off balance sheet financing mechanisms include consignment stock, sale and repurchase (or leaseback) arrangements, debt factoring, securitisation, creation of special purpose entities, and leasing. Example With leasing, on the one hand, an entity could acquire the right to use an asset through a rental agreement. On the other hand, the entity could purchase the same asset using external finance. While the two arrangements may result in identical net cash flows to the entity, in the case of a purchase both the asset and the associated financing obligation appear on the entity s balance sheet whereas in the former scenario rental payments are accounted for as a period expense, with the asset and corresponding liability omitted from the entity s balance sheet. Omission of the financing liability can have a flattering effect on key ratios such as leverage and interest coverage, while omission of the asset could help to inflate return on assets.    Sound commercial reasons may exist to explain the use off balance sheet financing. These include sharing with other parties the risks and benefits associated with certain assets and liabilities or gaining protection from selected risks. However, off balance sheet financing arrangements may also be motivated by wanting to reduce perceptions of risk or to camouflage the substance of particular transactions. Textbook examples of off balance sheet financing activity include Enron (in the form of special purpose entities) and Southern Cross (in the form of operating leases.

offset agreement,"An offset agreement is a type of side deal, sometimes best described as a sweetener. This is an agreement between two or more parties that provides additional benefits and is ancillary to another negotiated contract. The deal is between a government and company, often a defence company but it can also be used in big civil deals for items such as infrastructure and transport. The company is the one that provides the additional benefit, usually one that is meant to create jobs or wealth for the country's economy. Companies do this because it boosts their chance to win lucrative government contracts, particularly in developing countries. Countries do this because it makes it easier to justify large expenditures. A company s offset obligation is usually worth 50-100 per cent of the value of the contract and can be direct or indirect. Direct offsets are linked to the original defence contact. Companies often agree to transfer relevant technological knowhow or use local suppliers to build the equipment they are selling to the government. Indirect offsets, though prompted by the defence sale, have nothing to do with what the country is purchasing. These can include the company making or drumming up investments in local industries, or helping export a country s goods.   offset agreement in the news In 2013, a Financial Times investigation found that western defence companies had agreed $75bn of side deals, ranging from helping Omani fishermen to financing an Emirati beachfront metropolis, to win lucrative arms contracts. The FT s probe   based on data provided by IHS Jane s, the defence industry analyst   revealed the scale of the outstanding promises or  offsets  made by the world s 12 largest defence companies to win orders from countries seeking investments, jobs and technology. Defence companies had traded Tunisian olive oil for military transport planes; invested in fledgling airlines in Kazakhstan and Jordan; created a domestic aerospace industry for Turkey; and sent the first Malaysian astronaut into space. In Oman, BAE Systems had satisfied part of its offset obligation by luring fish to big, brightly coloured buoys, easing the work of local fishermen. Executives said that these side deals are becoming increasingly crucial to winning big international defence contracts as developing countries rank competing bids by the companies  willingness to commit billions of dollars to their economic and industrial development. Penalties for not delivering on side deals   which can run into the tens of millions of dollars   are kept even more secret than the deals themselves. Critics of these deals   such as the US government, the EU, World Trade Organisation and campaign group Transparency International   said they distort the market, lead governments to order arms they do not need and create opportunities for corruption.

Potential borrowers post their requests and indicate the amount of money they wish to borrow and they give out other  information that allows potential lenders to assess their creditworthiness. Potential lenders can then decide whether to supply money or not.  In the case of a successful loan, a fee is paid to the platform provider.ExampleA borrower, who might not want to use traditional financial intermediaries such as banks, could try to find potential lenders among people who share a similar characteristic such as religion, geography, hobbies or education.  This allows the lender to get a  better assessment of the borrower and develop the trust that is needed to lend money to the borrower, even without carrying out a formal creditworthiness assessment.

open collaborative innovation,"Open collaborative innovation refers to development projects in which multiple users collaborate and openly share what they develop.  Open collaborative innovation projects can be at a larger scale than any single user can undertake alone. Open collaborative innovation is enabled by lower collaboration costs, as people contribute for free, and lower design costs enabled by the Internet and by cost efficient computerised design tools.  This form of user innovation is breaking producers  former monopoly on the design of  big  projects. Examples Linux and other collaborative open source projects are developed by volunteers, and compete in scale with software products such Windows from Microsoft that contain millions of lines of code and require the coordinated efforts of many hundreds of developers. The development of new sports like whitewater kayaking or mountain biking was built upon the effort of thousands of volunteer enthusiast users, often working and sharing collaboratively over decades.

open economy,"An economy that allows free inflow and outflow of goods, services, capital and people. The opposite of a closed economy."
open innovation sharing,"Producer innovators invest in developing new products in order to sell them at a profit.  User innovators obtain their  profits  from an entirely different source. They benefit from personally using what they develop. For example if you develop a improved mixer to make a cake faster, you still get this time savings - a use-benefit - even if I make a copy of your mixer and save time too. For this reason, user-innovators often allow others to share what they have developed  for free  - because this encourages development, and they can still profit from their own use. Use benefit means that you are better off - although not necessarily financially - as a result of personally using the product you developed. Examples If I develop a mountain bike in order to use it, I get this benefit from personal use even if you copy my innovation for free and get benefit from using my innovation too. Also, if we share freely, others will improve what I have done and share it too - and I will benefit further.  Happily, since none of these creators are trying to create or enforce intellectual property rights, overhead costs of this innovative effort are greatly reduced to everyone s benefit. If a manufacturer develops a process machine in order to benefit from using it, my research along with that of several colleagues shows that these firms often reveal their process equipment innovations to equipment producer firms  for free.   Why   This is because the user-innovator firm still benefits from in-house use of the innovation, and the producer and other adopting users will increase these benefits by improving the machine further.

operations management,"This is the management of processes that create value for a company and its customers.  These processes transform inputs - such as materials, energy, services and people - into goods and services (outputs). Companies create value in different ways, whether it be manufacturing an aircraft or producing a television show.  Effective management of operations can represent a source of competitive advantage. Example Airlines have specific processes for dealing with customers effectively during the check-in process.  EasyJet Airlines have different customer service and gate operations compared to other competitors.  All its processes combine together to make EasyJet one of the most efficient and profitable companies in its industry. For example, as EasyJet Airlines do not assign seats at check-in, this encourages customers to get to the gate quickly and wait to board the airplane.  Once on board, customers quickly stow their luggage and find a seat to sit down. While some might think that assigning seats in advance is more efficient, however, the opposite is true.  A customer who has an assigned seat can take their time milling around, while EasyJet customers have to compete quickly with each other when it comes to choosing their desired seats. This process allows the airline to have very quick turnaround times, and thus utilise their most expensive assets (their airplanes) more than their competitors to be more profitable. [1]"

optimum currency area,"The theory of optimum currency areas (OCA) was first published by Robert Mundell in 1961. It shows that countries could join a monetary union if the costs of doing so are lower than the benefits. Basically, a monetary union is an irrevocable fixed exchange rate system. Mundell defines the absence of the exchange rate mechanism as the cost of monetary unions. For example, normally countries in economic trouble could devalue their currency and, in turn, increase exports. Within a monetary union, this adjustment is no longer feasible because no single country can influence the currency. However, the benefits of a monetary union include the gains of increasing trade between the involved countries, because trade is no longer hampered by rapid changes of exchange rates.  The theory predicts that the benefits of a monetary union will outperform its cost only if the transfer of capital and labour is high between the countries joining the union. For example, if there is a crisis in one country, labour and capital could freely move to countries with better economic performance and therefore prevent unemployment. Consequently, within a monetary union, the adjustment of exchange rates has to be replaced by the adjustment of labour and capital. ExampleThe European Monetary Union (EMU), founded in 1999, is the most prominent example of the OCA theory. However, somewhat curiously, the Maastricht criteria, which countries have to satisfy in order to join the EMU, are totally unrelated to the OCA criteria. The current sovereign debt crisis in the Euro area is perhaps one outcome of this deficiency. For example, there is still no free transfer of labour and capital between the countries of the EMU, which could have substituted for the absence of the exchange rate mechanism. Consequently, the troubled countries could either suffer high unemployment for a long time or leave the union. Once they leave, they are free to devalue their currency and therefore simulate exports and their economy. The theory requires a coordinated fiscal policy of the national governments within the monetary union with regards to spending and taxation in order to balance the impact of the unified monetary policy, that is one interest rate for all countries, despite different economic situations in each country. In a monetary union, with its single currency, there can only be one monetary policy or one interest rate. Such situations are especially painful if, like the EMU, no joint fiscal policy exists that could compensate for the lack of different monetary policies. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that the increasing intensity of trade within the EMU had a positive effect on business cycle synchronisation between the countries. That means a boom in one country triggers a boom in another country as well. But, of course, the same is true for a downturn in the business cycle. However, situations where some countries are booming and others are not   so-called  asymmetric shocks    are more dangerous for a monetary union (MU) because this requires different monetary policies, an option no longer available within an MU. For example, countries that are not experiencing a boom will find it difficult to recover as it does not have its own policy to manage its money supply and set interest rates. [1]"
option,"A contract that entitles the holder to buy or sell an underlying asset (stock, bond, commodity, currency, etc.) at a given price (the exercise or strike price) and before a certain date (the expiry date).  A call option entitles the holder to buy the underlying, while a put option gives the holder the right to sell. The institution selling the option (the option writer) commits to buy or sell the underlying asset if the holder exercises the contract (see naked option). However, the buyer of the option is not obliged to exercise the contract. This differentiates options from futures, which are an undertaking between two parties to buy or sell an underlying asset or commodity. The price paid by the investor to the option writer for the option is called the option premium. Options are used as a tool to leverage or hedge against changes in the value of the underlying asset. An investor can buy several combinations of calls and puts to take advantage of the widening or narrowing of the spread between the various options."

A call option entitles the holder to buy the underlying, while a put option gives the holder the right to sell. The institution selling the option (the option writer) commits to buy or sell the underlying asset if the holder exercises the contract (see naked option). However, the buyer of the option is not obliged to exercise the contract. This differentiates options from futures, which are an undertaking between two parties to buy or sell an underlying asset or commodity. The price paid by the investor to the option writer for the option is called the option premium. Options are used as a tool to leverage or hedge against changes in the value of the underlying asset. An investor can buy several combinations of calls and puts to take advantage of the widening or narrowing of the spread between the various options."

organisational ambidexterity,"An organisation's ability to pursue two disparate things at the same time, such as efficiency vs flexibility, low cost vs differentiation, global integration vs local responsiveness, exploitation vs exploration, stability vs adaptability, short-term profit vs long-term growth. Companies face both trade-off (either/or) and ambidextrous (both/and) decisions. Ambidexterity differs from trade-off in that it emphasises the simultaneous fulfillment of two disparate (and sometimes competing) ends. Organisational ambidexterity requires an effective reconciliation to simultaneously benefit and gain from distinctive forces or strategies. Ambidexterity offers more growth opportunities while allowing the firm to maintain stability. It provides more strategic options while allowing the firm to gain from experience. ref url """"]Yadong Luo, University of Miami[/ref]"
organisational culture,"The set of shared values and norms that characterise a particular organisation. A strong culture, in which members agree upon and care intensely about organisational values, can improve organisational performance by motivating employees and co-ordinating their behaviour. Organisational values can resonate with employees  higher ideals and rally them around a set of meaningful goals. They also focus employees  attention on organisational priorities, which then guide their behaviour and decision-making. One method for strengthening culture is to choose new employees based on culture fit. New employees can then be socialised into the culture by being taught its values and expected behaviours. Early employee-employer interactions are vital; they can determine the employee's desire to  buy in  to the company's philosophy and establish long-lasting patterns of behaviour. Example In the late 1990s, Cisco Systems developed culturally-consistent selection criteria, hiring candidates who were frugal, smart, enthusiastic about the future of the internet, and not obsessed with status. Cisco's hiring process helped it to maintain its culture and to be able to focus on improving its products and services.[1]"
organisational violence,"When organisations avoid ethical decision-making through a continual process of narrowing choices, thus making people and organisations suffer. Organisational violence is both a personal and organisational intrusion in society. Violence is created because of the absence ofthe following key components in the developmental process of people and companies: - the ability of people and organisations to effectively create bonds that foster collaboration and inclusiveness - inclusiveness as a high value in sharing the process of growth and understanding among people regarding the desired outcomes of organisations - balancing the need for individuality with the work ethic of team performance - embracing rather than discounting the introduction of ideas and ideals - resolving issues of control, power and authority - assessing dichotomies where choices are made about whether the end justifies the means. In evaluating organisational performance, organisational success must go beyond the completion of a project. Organisational success must be balanced by assessing the health of the employees and the organisational congruence of policies, procedures and practices with the outcomes of any projects. Example When organisations use emailing abusively, for example by requesting employees to check their emails and act upon them out of office hours, the pressure this can generate can be equal to violence. It is hard to assess, since it occurs only within personal levels of control, but the end result can be collectively generative, in terms of work-life balance and performance. [1] "
organisational virtuousness,"The display of virtuous practices and processes in organisations. It has been measured in empirical studies by assessments of a combination of the following practices: caring, compassionate support, forgiveness, inspiration, meaning, respect, integrity, and gratitude. The association between virtuous organisational practices and extraordinary organizational success has been confirmed. The concept of virtuousness is rooted in the Latin word virtus, or the Greek ar te, meaning the best of the human condition, the most ennobling behaviors and outcomes of people, the excellence and essence of humankind, and the highest aspirations of human beings.  Virtuous organisations aspire to those attributes. Virtuousness in organisations is not subservient to the desire for profitability, for example, nor does it replace a striving for instrumental outcomes.  Rather, organisational virtuousness possesses at least five attributes: (1) It enables a sense of meaning, well-being, and ennoblement in human beings.  (2) It is experienced cognitively, emotionally, and behaviourally.  (3) It is self-reinforcing, deviation amplifying, and creates sustainable positive energy.  (4) It pursues outcomes that are sufficient and are not a means to obtain another end. (5) It serves a buffering function from negative events and fosters resilience.  Example In a study of 40 US financial service organisations and 30 healthcare organizations over a two year period, all of the organisations agreed to try to implement these (above mentioned) virtuous practices at the organisation level.  In the financial services sector, this represented a major change from the traditional emphasis on short-term profits and competitive dynamics. However, the financial service firms that improved the most in their organisational virtuousness scores were significantly more profitable, had significantly higher customer retention, and enjoyed significantly more employee engagement than units that did not improve.  The same results were replicated in the health care sector.  Virtuousness in organisations produced significantly higher performance than the norm. [1]"

original issue discount OID,"The original issue discount is the different between a bond's (or any other debt's) face value and the amount for which it is sold by the issuer. Many bonds, especially those with low interest rates, are issued at a price less than par in order to entice buyers. For example, a $1,000 bond offering a 0.5 per cent coupon at maturity might be sold for less than $1,000. Generally, the lower the interest rate, the greater the original issue discount. Zero coupon bonds will often have the largest original issue discount. Original issue discounts on bonds expose the buyer to tax liabilities. The discount is counted as income because should the buyer wish to sell the bond, he will sell it at face value.   original issue discount (OID) in the news In July 2013 Reuters reported that software company Vitera Healthcare Solutions had cancelled a $365m loan choosing instead to finance a planned acquisition with equity. The planned loan was to have been in two tranches. The first seven year loan was to have had an original issue discount of 99. The eight year loan was offered at an original issue discount of 98.5."
original sin,"Original sin was first used in an economic sense in 1999 when economists Barry Eichengreen and Ricardo Hausmann described the developing world's inability to borrow abroad in their local currency the  original sin  of emerging markets. Prof Hausmann, who teaches economics at Harvard University, felt Christianity s doctrine of ancestral sin was a fitting metaphor:  It seemed to be a huge, persistent problem that all emerging markets were born with and had remarkable problems getting rid of,  he told the Financial Times. Original sin is a pernicious phenomenon. Borrowing in foreign currencies can both trigger and exacerbate financial and economic crises. When a country s debts are denominated in foreign currencies, it often forces policy makers to keep exchange rates pegged or heavily managed. If the rate buckles, the authorities have to burn through valuable reserves and raise interest rates to protect the value of the local currency   even in the midst of a recession if necessary. If the peg breaks and the local currency tumbles, the foreign currency-denominated debt burden becomes much greater and can result in defaults. Mexico s  tequila crisis  is an example of the dangers of original sin. Money had gushed into Mexico in the early 1990s but when Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, raised interest rates in 1994 the boom came to an abrupt end. By December the government tried to depreciate the peso but the currency crashed by more than 50 per cent and Mexico had to be bailed out by the International Monetary Fund. [1]   Original sin in the news In January 2013, an FT writer wrote that the ""original sin"" of emerging markets was slowly receding as many turned to swelling local bond markets instead. In June 2013, FT writers wrote that the reduction in ""classic"" original sin would help emerging markets resist the impact of the end of US monetary stimulus. But in January 2014, an FT writer discussed how emerging markets were looking vulnerable to the risk of a resurgent dollar. Emerging markets' original sin may have ameliorated, he wrote, but it was far from eliminated."

outright monetary transactions OMT,"The European Central Bank's outright monetary transactions (OMT) or bond-buying programme was announced by Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, in September 2012. Under the outright monetary transactions programme the ECB would offer to purchase eurozone countries  short-term bonds in the secondary market, to bring down the market interest rates faced by countries subject to speculation that they might leave the euro.  The size of the programme is unlimited, lending credence to Mr Draghi s remarks that he would do  whatever it takes  to save the euro. The ECB dropped any claim to seniority, which should reassure investors that any purchases would not subordinate their own holdings of peripheral bonds. As of February 2013 no country had yet applied for help under OMT, but the very fact of its existence had greatly calmed financial markets. Mr Draghi stressed that any purchases under the OMT would be subject to ""strict and effective"" fiscal conditions, most likely to take the form of austerity measures and structural reforms. This was seen as an important statement as it answers a perceived weakness of a previous ECB bond-buying plan, the Securities Markets Programme or SMP, which was both limited in its scope and unconditional. However, the risk that a government might renege on its promises after receiving help has prompted suggestion that the OMT works best if it is not put into action.   outright monetary transactions (OMT) in the news Some have argued the ECB should have acted much sooner, rather than encouraging austerity measures implemented as a response to the crisis. In February 2013, FT columnist Martin Wolf wrote: ""By adopting OMT earlier, the ECB could have prevented the panic that drove the [bond] spreads that justified the austerity. It did not do so. Tens of millions of people are suffering unnecessary hardship. It is tragic."" Meanwhile it was reported that some investors and analysts were wondering if the OMT programme's achilles heel was its requirement for governments to sign up to a reform programme likely to include austerity measures. They pointed to the outcome of the  February 2013 elections in Italy. It was said that the inconclusive election was a result of the Italian people's rejection of harsh austerity measures that had deepened the country's recession.  "

outsourcing,"The contracting out of work to an outside supplier. Source: Financial Times Outsourcing can be defined as turning over all or part of an activity to a supplier. While outsourcing was originally restricted to basic activities, it currently pervades the management of many companies. Outsourcing is generally considered a very powerful tool to cut costs and improve service quality because it enables companies to take advantage of specialised suppliers. It can also help firms focus on their core business by transferring non-core activities to suppliers.  For instance, Apple outsources the manufacturing of products such as notebooks, the iPod and iPhone to reduce costs. This leaves Apple free to focus on the design and the functional capabilities that are crucial in making their computers and consumer electronics more competitive. Outsourcing also has disadvantages that include losing control over the outsourced activity or even exposing clients to the potential opportunism of suppliers. For instance, suppliers may charge excess fees for services that are not included in the contract. They may also make promises knowing well that they will break these in an instant, should the benefits from breaking these promises exceed the costs or disadvantages. ExampleBoeing had always designed and built its planes in-house, but the company made the decision to outsource most of the 787 Dreamliner s manufacturing to a global network of over 50 suppliers. The original idea was both to save money and to increase flexibility by shifting risks to suppliers.  Only the final assembly would be performed by Boeing using modules provided by the suppliers. By mid-2009, the project was two years behind schedule. A major reason for the delay is that Boeing did somehow lose control over its suppliers. The underlying rationale is that the company did not necessarily have the required expertise to manage a network of suppliers.  In addition, some suppliers were unable to live up to the expectations of Boeing. As a result, Boeing brought back major production lines in-house and hired engineers to oversee its suppliers.

overconfidence,"In business or trading, an overestimation of one's abilities and of the precision of one's forecasts. Overconfident people set overly narrow confidence intervals in making predictions. They tend to overweigh their own forecasts relative to those of others. The self-serving attribution bias, under which individuals attribute past successes to their own skills and past failures to bad luck, can lead to overconfidence. In the context of financial markets, the confidence of a self-attributing investor increases when public information is in line with his or her forecast, but it does not decrease as much when public information contradicts his or her forecast. The investor therefore gains excessive confidence over time, after receiving different confirming and disconfirming public news. A similar cognitive bias, illusory superiority (or the above average effect), also causes people to overestimate their own abilities. Evidence of this bias is documented in studies that ask subjects to assess their abilities - indeed, a vast majority of people say they are above the average. Example Investors who overestimate their own abilities trade excessively, even though trading is costly and lowers their net returns. Overconfident managers can make suboptimal investment, mergers and acquisitions and financing decisions, destroying company value. [1]"

The properties are bought and sold subject to various contractual arrangements and annual fees charged linked to the care, upkeep, and facilities provided. House types vary from flats in apartment blocks to standalone properties in retirement villages. Surveys in England suggest high levels of user satisfaction, especially when good contacts with family and friends are sustained. Ownership is valued for the sense of independence it offers, the continued existence of housing equity, and the absence of the future housing cost risks that arise when renting. Older people move far less than those younger, frequently exhibiting strong attachment to the home and neighbourhood they are used to, even in countries where the elderly have a much wider range of more affordable housing choices than in the UK. Triggers for moves are retirement, when for example some may chase the sun or sea; the adverse effects of isolation, possibly as a consequence of the recent loss of a spouse or other loved-one; and a need for higher care levels. Specialised retirement accommodation represents only small parts of the housing stock consumed by the elderly. However, as populations age, the mobility effects of ageing are becoming more prevalent and the role of specialised retirement accommodation is growing. Example In the UK, older homeowners are less able to move into OORH because of its high cost. This is caused by general planning-induced land shortages, which raise the price of all new housing, but also because the constraints, paradoxically, are particularly strong with respect to private retiree housing.

ownership concentration,"Ownership concentration refers to the amount of stock owned by individual investors and large-block shareholders (investors that hold at least 5 per cent of equity ownership within the firm). In publicly traded firms, large block holders are normally institutional investors in the form of pension funds and mutual funds. A higher level of ownership concentration or more block holders suggest a stronger monitoring power from investors over a firm s managerial decisions because of the incentives from these owners to proactively safeguard their investment. Owners with significant amount of shares may take aggressive actions, either directly or indirectly, over firm decisions such as the election of board members and replacement of CEO or poor management with their voting power. As such, ownership concentration can be an internal governance mechanism that helps reduce the likelihood of managerial opportunism because managers and boards of directors are more likely to take into account the preferences and interests of large shareholders. By contrast, firms with a low level of ownership concentration (diffused ownership) might indicate weaker governance power because investors with less ownership interests have little incentive to pay attention to the strategic decisions of the firm and thus, are less motivated to closely monitor and discipline top executive behaviors. Compared to large block holders, small investors are more likely to  vote with their feet  in cases of poor firm performance. Example Large investors are more likely than small ones to actively voice their concerns over the firm s strategies and board governance. A recent example is that large institutional shareholders of BSkyB were putting pressure on James Murdoch, the non-executive Chairman of the board, to step down after the phone-hacking scandal at News Corp where Mr Murdoch holds dual roles as a CEO/Chairman. Large owners have strong incentives to safeguard their investment in the event of corporate scandals (unethical behaviors, financial restatement, accounting misrepresentation, etc.) because they are likely to suffer significant losses once the scandal is publicly discovered. For top executives involved in the inappropriate practices, such scandals can cause them negative reputation and image, employment, and sometimes personal costs.

pari passu,"Pari passu is a Latin phrase used in legal terminology to mean equal footing.    pari passu in the news The term pari passu appeared frequently in the news from 2012 as creditors awaited the latest twist in the Argentine bond saga. Argentina defaulted on nearly $100bn of its bonds in 2001 and agreed restructuring terms (which involved haircuts of between 45 per cent and 75 per cent) with over 90 per cent of its creditors. The remaining creditors held out for full payment and were joined by some opportunistic investors, including hedge funds, that bought the bonds at extremely low prices with the aim of also holding out for full payment. In 2012, hold-out creditors led by a fund called Elliott won a favourable judgement from a New York judge  who acccepted that the principle of pari passu should apply and ruled that hold-out creditors' bonds should be treated the same was as those of holders of the restructured debt. Holders of the original bonds and the so-called exchange bonds would each therefore be entitled to the same ratable payments. This meant that if Argentina intended to repay exchange bond holders in full it would also have to repay the hold-outs in full. If, however, it intended to pay the hold-outs only a percentage then the same percentage payment would be due to the exchange bond holders. The ruling therefore raised the possibility that Argentina would default on its debt again and have to seek restructuring of its exchange bonds. Argentina has strongly rejected the idea that it should pay a penny to the hold-outs. At the end of February 2013 parties were awaiting a decision on Argentina's appeal against the judgement. "

pay-performance sensitivity,"This is a measure to find out if a chief executive is compensated appropriately according to how well s/he runs the company. Pay-performance sensitivity is the change in a chief executive's payoff that is associated with a given performance of the company that s/he leads. In its simplest incarnation, the pay-performance sensitivity is the correlation between a chief executive pay and stock return a cross a large number of chief executives and their companies. Pay-performance sensitivity is measured in a variety of ways. One is the dollar increase in a chief executive's wealth associated with a 1,000 dollar increase in the firm s market capitalisation. Another is the dollar increase or the percentage increase in a chief executive's wealth associated with a 1% equity return or stock return. Pay-performance sensitivity measures are used as indicators of the quality of corporate governance.  Everything else equal, a larger sensitivity is sign of a better alignment between the chief executive incentives and the interest of his/ her shareholders.  Sensitivity is larger when the pay responds more to changes in performance. ExampleIn their research paper ""Executive Compensation: Facts"", Gian Luca Clementi and Thomas Cooley, at NYU Stern School of Business, carried out calculations on compensation data for chief executives of US publicly traded companies. Over the period between 1993 to 2008, a 1% increase in market capitalisation was associated with a 1.14% median increase in a chief executive's wealth.

payday lender,"Payday lenders extend loans for small sums to borrowers who are supposedly able to repay the loan on their next pay day, or when they next receive a welfare benefit payment. Payday lenders typically charge extremely high interest rates but will accept large numbers of borrowers who are unable to gain credit elsewhere and will get the loan to them fast. Many of these borrowers, however, struggle to repay the loans and are hit by the high interest rates.    payday lenders in the news In the years following the 2008 financial crisis, a squeeze on household budgets saw more households turn to payday lenders. Estimates of exorbitant annual interest rates charged by some payday lenders in the UK ranged between 4,000 per cent and 16,000 per cent, and there was a call to cap loan interest rates. US payday lenders were said to have been targeting the UK market because interest rates on borrowing had been capped in many US states. Rate caps are also already in use in other countries including Germany, Canada and parts of Australia. In March 2013, the UK Office of Fair Trading, gave UK payday lenders 12 weeks to change their business practices or risk losing their credit licences. An OFT investigation found that up to half of payday lenders' revenue came from loans that were not paid back on time and were rolled over or refinanced. In addition, the OFT claimed, payday loan providers compete on the speed with which they agree credit rather than the cost of the loan, which distorts the incentive to carry out proper affordability assessments. The OFT estimated that payday lenders provided  2bn- 2.2bn worth of loans in 2011/12 against  900m in 2008/9.   "

Employers are then required to process adjusted pay as you earn (PAYE) codes, as well as submitting a P11D for each employee. Payrolling of benefits is an alternative system, under which employers do not have to operate adjusted PAYE codes; instead the cash equivalent of the benefit is added to the employee s pay and PAYE operated on the total. This system has operated informally, but HMRC are consulting on the introduction of a statutory framework for voluntary payrolling, as a simplification measure. After the initial consultation, it has been decided that as a first step car, car fuel, medical insurance and subscriptions such as gym membership will be included in the scheme; more detailed consultation is ongoing about implementation."

The letter drew on the work of an organisation called Gapminder which gathers statistical information and presents it in a digestible fashion. A key feature of the arguments put forward in the letter was the work of Hans Rosling, professor of international health at the Karolinska Institute, who argues that, due to improved health care and child life expectancy, birth rates are falling. He says that contrary to popular belief, women start choosing to have fewer children once education and health improves to the extent that the women believe their children are likely to survive into adulthood. Because of falling birth rates there will never be more children in the world than there are today   we are at peak child.

peak oil,"The debate over  peak oil    the point at which the world s oil supplies go into irreversible decline   is a long-running argument that has not yet had much impact on energy policy. Some geologists argue that peak oil is either very close or has passed, and the world will never again be able to produce the 83m barrels per day that flowed in 2008. They are exasperated by what they see as the complacency of policymakers and analysts, particularly the International Energy Agency, which predicted that oil production could reach 103m barrels per day by 2030.  [1] ViewThe burning issue   peak oil in the news In April 2013, the FT's commodities editor pointed out that the focus on peak oil had shifted from discussion over a peak in supply to the possibility of a peak in demand. He pointed to a paper from an oil analyst at Citigroup who wrote that the substitution of natural gas for oil combined with increasing fuel economy meant oil demand was approaching a tipping point. In August 2013, an FT writer commented on the closure of The Oil Drum, a specialist oil blog site. She said its archiving had nothing to do with the demise of the concept of peak oil because of its increasing extraction from new sources."

peer-to-peer P2P lending,"Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending describes a growing trend in the UK and the US and sees cash-rich investors bypass banks and lend directly to borrowers, often through online peer-to-peer lending platforms. Both the investor and the borrower benefits as the lender achieves higher interest rates and the borrower lower interest rates than would be on offer if either had gone through a bank. Although some peer-to-peer platforms have developed funds to compensate lenders in the event of a borrower default, lenders are still at more risk because loans are generally unsecured.   peer-to-peer lending in the news In July 2013 an FT report looked at research into peer-to-peer lending (P-to-P) by the Open Data Institute which found that between October 2010 and May 2013 nearly 49,000 investors in the UK funded loans worth more than  378m. Some, including Zopa and RateSetter, arrange loans between individuals. Others such as Funding Circle lend to small and medium-sized businesses.

pension buy-in,"A pension buy-in is the process by which trustees of a pension scheme buy an insurance policy to cover a group of their members, for example, current pensioners already in payment. The trustees hold the policy as an asset and remain responsible for paying the pensions. The members remain within the original scheme.This differs from a pension buyout where the assets and liabilities of the entire scheme are transferred to an insurer."
pension buyout,"A pension buyout enables a company to completely wind up its pension scheme and transfer both its assets and its liabilities (and usually the payment of a cash premium) to an insurance company which becomes responsible for honouring pension promises as scheme members retire. Once the buyout is complete, all links with the former sponsor and trustees are severed and the scheme member is issued with a contract from the insurance company. The solution is beneficial to scheme members because final salary schemes have become increasingly expensive for companies to fund because many schemes are in deficit. At the same time people are living longer and returns from low-risk assets have declined. Once the buyout is complete the pension will be paid by the insurance company rather than the employer which protects scheme members from the risk that their benefits might be reduced because their employer has become insolvent while the pension scheme is in deficit. Capital requirements for insurance companies are much higher than for most employers, so there is more of a cushion.   pension buyout in the news Citigroup sold EMI Group's  1.5bn pension fund to the Pension Insurance Corporation, the UK's largest pension insurance buyout. "
pension credit,"Pension credit is a benefit for pensioners on low and modest incomes, to give them a guaranteed level of income without penalising them for having small amounts of savings.

pension plan,"A system by which an employer, insurance company etc provides workers with a pension after they have made regular payments over many years. [1] "
pension plan/scheme,"A programme established by a company to pay retirement benefits to its employees. There are two basic types of pension plan - defined-benefit, which commits to paying a specified amount to each employee on retirement, depending on the years of work and salary level; and defined-contribution, for which contributions are specified but the amount received by the employee is not fixed."
pension pot,"A pension pot is the total amount that a person has saved into a money purchase or defined contribution pension scheme. The size of a pension pot will depend on how much money has been contributed, how well the funds were invested, and how high the fees were that the investment manager charged for its services. Many kinds of pension scheme can have money purchase arrangements that result in the accrual of a pension pot. They might be personal pensions or occupational pensions (those that are arranged by an employer). The term pension pot is not used for defined benefit or final salary scheme because the size of the pension a person will get in such a scheme does not depend on the size of the pension pot. Employees with a pension pot can buy an annuity which will pay a set amount each year, depending which kind of annuity a person chooses, based on the total size of the pension pot. In the UK it is also sometimes possible to choose a drawdown pension which pays an agreed amount per year from the pension pot leaving the remainder of the money invested.   pension pot in the news In February 2014 it emerged that UK pension companies would be forced to reveal charges that are currently not disclosed. The move followed a report from the Office of Fair Trading which found that an annual 0.50 per cent total charge would reduce the size of a pension pot after 40 years of saving by roughly 11 per cent, while all-in costs of 1.0 per cent would cut the pot by 21.2 per cent."

performance appraisal,"In general, a performance appraisal is a meeting between an employee and a manager to discuss the quality of the employee's work, and areas for future progress. [1] In fund management, performance or manager appraisal is the systematic evaluation of the investment performance of a collectively managed pool of assets in order to understand the abilities of a fund manager to deliver future performance.  Performance appraisal is a formal and structured process and relies heavily on benchmark comparison.  Such appraisal results in an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of a manager and his ability to deliver on a stated benchmark goal.  It can sometimes be called manager appraisal.  It identifies where a fund manager is adding or destroying value and should picks up any changes in style and investment process. In this respect, the aim of performance appraisal is to identify where a the value added by a fund manager s return is positive relative to his contribution to performance against the appropriate benchmark.  It also identifies where there is no value added or indeed value that is  being destroyed by a fund manager relative to his contribution to performance against the appropriate benchmark.   Performance appraisal is typical done at regular meetings which are designed to review the performance and attribution of a fund managers delivered returns against the relevant benchmark or designated index. For example, a UK equity manager may be compared to the FT All share index. [2]"

performance evaluation,Another name for performance appraisal. [1] 
performance fees,"A performance fee is a sum paid to the manager of an investment vehicle and is based on outperformance of a stated benchmark. Performance fees are most often associated with hedge funds although they have been applied to other investment vehicles such as investment trusts. Hedge fund performance fees have been notoriously generous to hedge fund managers who have typically been able to charge investors on a ""2 and 20"" structure of 2 per cent of the invested amount per year plus 20 per cent of any outperformance (although this has been eroded in recent years). Investment advisers counsel investors to check that any chosen benchmark is relevant to the kinds of investment being made by the fund. Also, investors should ensure that the performance fee structure includes a high water mark which means a fund manager can only start earning performance fees again, in a fund which has lost value, when it passes its previous highest value.   performance fees in the news In November 2013, it was reported that JPMorgan had succumbed to fee pressure and decided to smooth performance fees over a three year period. The move followed increased pressure from pension funds who are themselves under pressure to deliver lower cost investments to their members. It also followed the news in June 2013 that the European parliament had narrowly voted down proposals to fine fund managers who charge performance fees even when they are below par."

[1] "
performance review,Another name for performance appraisal. [1] 
performance-related,"Performance-related payments, benefits etc are ones that increase when your work improves or becomes more productive and decrease if the opposite happens. [1] "
performance-related pay,"Performance-related pay involves linking the pay executives get with their performance on the job. Typically, it involves solving a problem in economics called moral-hazard. Once a contract has been agreed, the company runs the risk that a high-paid worker will shirk on the job. Therefore companies typically tie the pay of the manager with the performance of the company by paying the manager with restricted stock or options. If the pay of the manager drops (through the drop in the share price) when he shirks relative to when he works hard, he will be motivated to work hard. This solution does not solve a second problem in economics called adverse selection. Offering a contract with a high level of options will tend to attract optimistic candidates who are confident they can achieve an increase in share price. In many cases, these managers end up being too optimistic which might hurt shareholder value. [1] Example In their research paper The cross-section of stock returns and incentive pay, Mike Cooper, Huseyin Gulen and Raghavendra Rau show that firms that pay their CEOs in the top ten per cent of excess pay relative to their peers earn negative abnormal returns over the next three years of approximately -9 per cent. The effect is stronger for CEOs who receive higher incentive pay relative to their peers. They argue that their results are consistent with high-pay induced CEO overconfidence and investor overreaction towards firms with high paid CEOs.  "

pivot,"When used in relation to entrepreneurship, pivot (which generally refers to a shift in strategy) describes the tortured path that most start-ups go through to find the right customer, value proposition, and positioning. Eric Ries, the creator of the 'Lean Startup' methodology, reminds us that pivots imply keeping one foot firmly in place as you shift the other in a new direction. In this way, new ventures process what they have already learned from past success and failure and apply these insights in new areas. Don t get caught traveling as you jump from idea to idea without absorbing lessons learned along the way The pivot is often driven by specific customer feedback.  A successful serial entrepreneur once told me,  a business plan is just one way to get close to the customer and figure out what they really want . That is why it might be most useful to think about a start-up as a continuous process to deliver value to a specific set of customers. Example Groupon famously pivoted from their original aim to organise social advocacy campaigns and turned into a billion dollar daily deal site. [1]"

He pointed out that the UK's economy was depressed and had lots of capacity standing idle (a large output gap) and it had done for for years (persistent). In this plog scenario, actual growth stays below the economy's potential output as spare resources do not force companies to lower prices or workers to accept lower wages.

plus factors,"The term plus factors refers to economic circumstantial evidence of collusion above and beyond the parallel movement of prices by firms in an industry.  Plus factors are the economic criteria that can assist with the diagnosis of collusion. Plus factors can be differentiated in terms of their strength.  When a plus factor delivers a strong inference of collusion, that plus factor is referred to as a super-plus factor. For example, if firms engage in interfirm transactions that are transfers of resources and are largely void of productive noncollusive motivations, that conduct would be a super-plus factor. If collusive firms view super-plus factors as something that will be used by courts to draw a strong inference of explicit collusion, then colluding firms will try to avoid creating super-plus factors. However, avoiding super-plus factors can greatly encumber the profitability and stability of a cartel. Example Prosecuted cartels in vitamins and organic peroxides were found to have arranged periodic  true-up,  which were purchases between cartel firms to rectify differences in realised cartel market shares from the agreed-to levels. Such transactions would be viewed as plus factors. [1] See Article - Double trouble for telecoms companies      "

poison pill,"Series of possible strategies designed to fend off a hostile takeover. One example is offering discounted shares to current shareholders (but not the potential acquirer) in order to dilute whatever stake the acquirer may hold and increase the cost of an acquisition. Or issuing special bonds, preferred shares or warrants to shareholders exercisable only in the case of a takeover, making the cost of the acquisition prohibitive. There are other types of poison pills. A people pill involves the threatened resignation of the whole management team in the event of a successful takeover.

It is related to window dressing and the so called  January effect  and the  sell in May and go away  axiom.ExampleProfessional portfolio managers  efforts to maximize their own benefits/remuneration lead them to rebalance portfolios and window dress in predictable ways throughout the year. The high returns on risky securities around the turn of the year are caused by systematic shifts in the portfolio holdings of professional portfolio managers who rebalance their portfolios to affect performance-based remuneration. Institutional investors are net buyers of risky securities around the turn of the year when they are motivated to include less well known, high risk securities in their portfolios to try to outperform their benchmarks. Later in the year, portfolio managers (as they rebalance their portfolios) lock in returns by divesting from lesser-known risky stocks and replacing them with well known safer stocks or risk-free securities, such as government bonds. At the same time, they also switch to stocks or securities they perceive to be less risky and more glamorous in order to spruce up their portfolios (i.e., window dress). The excess demand for risky stocks at the beginning of the year bids the prices of these securities up. As the year draws to a close, the supply of relatively higher-risk stocks grows and the prices decline. [1]"

positive energy networks,"Research has discovered that individuals can be identified as 'positive energisers' or 'negative energizers', and that the difference has important implications.  Positive energisers create and support vitality in others.  They uplift and boost people.  Interacting with positive energisers leaves others feeling lively and motivated.  They build energy in people.  In contrast, negative energisers deplete the good feelings and enthusiasm of others.  They sap strength from and weaken people.  They leave others feeling exhausted and diminished.  Positive energising is a learned behavior, not a personality attribute.  The correlation between positive energy and the personality factor extraversion/introversion, for example, is very low.  It is not a matter of merely being gregarious or outgoing.  People learn how to become positive energizers.  Positive energy networks are constructed in the same way as information networks or influence networks in network research (ie - all individuals in the organisation are rated on a '1' to '7' scale by all other individuals based on how positively or negatively energising they are).  An individual's position in the energy network is far more predictive of their own and their unit s success than their position in the information or influence networks.  Moreover, conducting a diagnosis of the positive energy network in an organisation helps to identify positive energy hubs, black holes, and peripheral members that may need development.  Example A variety of organisations, including Zingermans, Weston, the Veteran s Hospital System, the US Army, Prudential, M&T; Bank, the Henry Ford Health System, and Chrysler have used energy networks to create 'change teams'.  When a major change initiative based on positive organisational scholarship is being implemented, energy networks are generated, and the hubs or nodes of those networks are selected as members of the change teams. One CEO reported:  So, we identified a set of positively energising and positively deviant people.  They were not the most senior or experienced people, but they were people who provided a real uplift to the organisation.  We selected 26 of them from across the world...They were able to introduce POS concepts ...and have now become their own self-sustaining effort in continuing to bring the principles of POS into our organisation."" [1]"
positive leadership,"An emphasis on: - what elevates individuals and organisations (as well as what challenges them) - what goes right in organisations (as well as what goes wrong) - what is life-giving (as well as what is problematic or life-depleting) - what is experienced as good (as well as what is objectionable) - what is extraordinary (in addition to what is merely effective) - what is inspiring (as well as what is difficult). Positive leadership uses scientific evidence and theoretically-grounded principles to promote outcomes such as thriving at work, interpersonal flourishing, virtuous behaviours, positive emotions, and energising networks. Positive leadership has at least three areas of emphasis.  Firstly, positive leadership enables 'positively deviant' performance.  This means its focus is on outcomes that dramatically exceed common or expected performance.  Next, positive leadership has an affirmative bias.  Its orientation is toward enabling thriving and flourishing at least as much as addressing obstacles and impediments. Finally, positive leadership focuses on facilitating the best of the human condition, or on virtuousness.  It is based on a eudaemonic assumption that is, that an inclination exists in all human systems toward achieving the very best of the human condition so the focus is on unlocking this potential in organisations. Example Jim Mallozzi, former senior vice-president of Prudential Retirement and, subsequently, chief executive of Prudential Real Estate and Retirement, described the result of his single-minded focus on positive leadership:  ""We started to introduce POS into our organization . . . and, sure enough, we went from an $140 million loss to a $20 million profit, and we actually achieved two times our expected business plan.  We doubled our profits from what we'd expected.  Our employee satisfaction scores went up in nine out of twelve categories. I had been hoping for eight out of twelve, but we got nine out of twelve. I got 110 written pages of comments in our EOS survey, 60 were about the positive changes in our company."" [1]"
positive net worth,The amount by which a company's assets are greater than its liabilities. [1] 
positive organisational scholarship (POS),"Positive Organisational Scholarship (POS) is an umbrella concept used to unify a variety of approaches in organisational studies, each of which incorporates the notion of 'the positive'. POS is concerned primarily with the study of especially positive outcomes, processes, and attributes of organisations and their members.  POS is distinguished from traditional organisational studies in that it seeks to understand what represents the best of the human condition.  Each term in the title of POS highlights particular biases: - Positive: POS seeks to understand especially positive states, dynamics, and outcomes in as much as they usually receive little attention in traditional organisational studies.  Whereas POS does not reject the examination of dysfunctions, or dynamics that disable or produce harm, it does tend to emphasise the examination of factors that enable positive consequences for individuals, groups, and organisations. 'Positive', in other words, represents an affirmative bias and orientation, not a substitute for other more common organisational phenomena.  - Organisational: POS examines positive phenomena within organisations as well as positive organisational contexts themselves. POS expands the boundaries of these theories to make visible positive states, positive processes, and positive relationships that are typically ignored within organisational studies.  A POS lens exposes new and different mechanisms through which positive organisational dynamics and processes produce extraordinarily positive or unexpected outcomes.  - Scholarship: There is no lack of self-help accounts that prescribe relatively simple and uncomplicated prescriptions for achieving happiness, fulfillment, or effectiveness.  POS does not stand in opposition to the array of self-help publications, but it extends beyond them in its emphasis on rigorous, systematic, and theory-based foundations for positive phenomena.  POS requires careful definitions of terms, a rationale for prescriptions and recommendations, consistency with scientific procedures in drawing conclusions, and grounding in previous related work.   Example Numerous organisations have systematically implemented practices based on positive organisational scholarship. Just after Cigna Retirement and Prudential Retirement merged, the chief executive determined to create a POS culture.  The group spent three or four years implementing POS practices. The result, according to the CEO: ""The primary outcome was the assimilation of the two companies. We kept 95 per cent of our clients. Our annual employee satisfaction scores and employee opinion survey results increased. We had less voluntary turnover, and the earnings of the company started going up at about 20 per cent per annum on a compound rate. It was a real success story."" Griffin Hospital transformed from a health care facility in economic difficulty and with quality problems to extraordinary financial success, the only hospital listed for ten years on Fortune Magazine s Best Companies to Work For, and a national quality award in 2010. Infuse Medical continues to sustain double digit growth and expansion by consciously facilitating a corporate culture  based on positive organizational scholarship i.e., validated, empirically-derived positive practices.

post-merger integration,"The period that starts at the closing of a deal but which can last from a few months to a number of years.  The post-merger integration is the time in an acquisition when all of the operations of the target company are absorbed into the buyer.  If the deal was structured as a merger, then this is the time when the operations of both legacy companies are combined.ExampleThe post-merger integration should first be discussed before the deal is even announced.  The Spanish banking group, Grupo Santander, is one of the companies that do post-merger integration consistently well in their acquisitions. They meet the target companies  management to plan the integration even before the deal is announced, if possible, and more intensely soon after announcement. For example, when they purchased UK-based Abbey National in November 2004, in a deal that had been announced in late July the same year, they embarked on an intensive 100 day post-merger integration plan focused on cutting costs:  headcount reductions and a new, much tighter, cost management and procurement procedure. In addition, they immediately embarked on a multi-year plan for the move of back-office systems to Santander s main site and to implement new sales techniques in the UK. [1]"

power distance,"The extent to which people view unequal status differences as legitimate. Coined by Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede, this concept can be used to compare groups, organisations, and nations. Groups with low power distance expect more democratic systems of relationships. In such groups, subordinates feel that they have the right to contribute to the decision-making process. In contrast, members of groups with high power distance are usually less willing to express doubts or disagreements with their bosses. Work teams that are higher in power distance are more positively affected by the efforts of transformational leaders than teams that are lower in power distance. This may be due to the fact that individuals in high power distance groups have greater respect for authority and may therefore be more open to leaders  efforts to influence the group. Example The United States and China are both economic juggernauts, but they are on opposite ends of the spectrum with respect to power distance. China is characterised by high power distance - its citizens are more inclined to accept inequalities in work environments and are more deferential to formal authority. In contrast, the United States is relatively low in power distance, which is reflected in its more egalitarian work environments and more decentralised power structures.[1]"

praise sandwich,"A technique used, generally at work, to reduce any unpleasantness when giving someone negative feedback. This is done by praising the individual, then stating the criticism and ending with some compliments. [1] Advocates of the technique say that this builds trust, makes people more receptive to criticism and surmounts a managerial terror of bluntness. But critics argue that it is manipulative, confusing and obstructs timely feedback by obliging managers to store up nice things to say to cushion the bad stuff. [2]   praise sandwich in the news In June 2011, the FT writer Tim Harford wrote the praise sandwich is a criticism made palatable because it is concealed between two layers of praise. For example, ""I think this is really good, creative work. It would be wonderful if you could [insert important feedback here]. But overall, as I say, it s really very good."" He said the technique works because of what the behavioural economist Richard Thaler calls ""hedonic editing"". As losses are far more painful than gains, it is worth bundling losses together with larger gains   if one receives a tax refund of  150 but lose  10 in the street, hedonic editing is the process of rolling the two together for a net  140 gain. Mr Harford stated that the praise sandwich deploys the same principle: it allows people to save face. Yet as a feedback technique it is risky: the sandwiched-between praise may be lost in the whole. He gave an example: ""You say, 'It s excellent, but you need to fix  '. I hear 'It is broadly excellent'. I feel better, but I will not become better."" [3]"

pregnant presenteeism,"The term  Presentees  describes employees who attend work when they are ill. I have coined-the phrase  pregnant presenteeism  specifically to describe pregnant workers who resist taking sick leave when they are unwell. Pregnant presenteeism occurs among women who are worried about organisational tendencies to assume that women s health is poor, especially in comparison with men s health. Although in practice, gender may not be a predictor of sickness absence, workplaces can nevertheless presume that women are more likely to be ill than men. In particular, it is commonly believed by employers that pregnant women will be unwell during their pregnancies. For this reason, although research does not substantiate links between pregnancy and sickness absence, employers tend to fear that employed pregnant women are likely to be ill, away from work and unreliable. In order to counter such assumptions and maintain their career progress, some pregnant employees are determined to appear healthy and dependable at work, regardless of whether they feel ill. As a result, some pregnant women ignore illness and pretend to line managers and colleagues that they are  functioning normally  even when seriously unwell. In such cases (whether poor health is due to pregnancy or for other reasons) sick pregnant women remain present at work; hence the description  pregnant presentees .    pregancy in the news Debates about pregnancy and work are considered from the perspective of employers and pregnant women themselves in an FT on-line article by Natasha Stidder, Bridging the Gaps created by maternity leave, 19 April 2012.[1]"

The technique encourages dissent in that it encourages people who might otherwise have been unwilling to speak out to describe real and imagined flaws in the project under discussion. The premortem is said to be based on research conducted in 1989 that found that prospective hindsight   imagining the event has already occurred   increases the ability to predict future outcomes. The term is embraced by economist Daniel Kahneman, in his book, Thinking, fast and slow.   premortem in the news The idea of conducting a premortem had reached such currency in March 2012 that the Asian Development Bank published a paper on how to conduct the technique.

price-to-book ratio,"The price/book (p/b) ratio, sometimes called the market-to-book ratio, links the stock/share price of a company with the book or accounting value of shareholders  equity per share. It reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share.So if the share price is $10 and shareholders  equity is $5, investors are ready to pay two times the book value. In an efficient market, the share price should reflect a firm s future value creation potential whereas the accounting or book value of equity reflects the accumulation of past share issues and past retained profits/earnings, i.e. not yet distributed in dividends.A higher p/b ratio should reflect greater expected future gains because of perceived growth opportunities and/or some competitive advantages and/or lesser risk but at the same time it indicates that the share price is relatively more expensive.During periods where markets are out of equilibrium, for example during a bubble, high p/b ratios may also reflect over-optimism and over-pricing. Conversely, a lower p/b ratio can reflect either poorer future opportunities or potentially a bargain if the market is over-pessimistic or if one believes the market is not taking into account potential restructuring or a takeover that would improve future prospects. ExampleA p/b greater than one means the market value of the company is greater than its book value, this difference is sometimes called the market value added or market goodwill. It is because accounting poorly reflects the internally generated intangible assets of new economy firms, they generally have higher p/b ratios than the more traditional  bricks and mortar  type firms that have more tangible assets sitting on their balance sheet.The p/b ratio, like other pricing ratios such as the price/earnings, price/sales or price/cash flows, is often used in valuing firms or takeover targets by finding the p/b ratio of a set of comparable companies and applying it to the target s current or forecasted book value.

price/earnings ratio,"A company's share price divided by the amount of profits it makes for each share in a 12-month period. PE ratios are normally calculated on the base of all the profit made in the period, whether or not the profit is paid out to shareholders in that period. [1] PE ratio, P/E ratio or PER for short, this is a company's share price divided by its earnings per share (EPS), expressed as a number or as a multiple of EPS (P/E multiple). The earnings used for the calculation can be either the amount most recently reported by the company, or an analyst's projection of future earnings (normally the current year or the year after that). An important indication of comparative value - investors are normally better off buying a stock with a low P/E ratio than one with a high ratio, as they are getting more earnings for their money. [2] The price/earnings ratio or p/e ratio links the stock/share price of a company with the earnings per share (profit for the year divided by number of outstanding shares). It reflects how many times earnings investors are ready to pay for a share. So if the share price is $10 and earnings per share is $1, investors are ready to pay 10 times earnings.In an efficient market, the share price should reflect a firm s future value creation potential, greater value creation can indicate greater future dividends from the company.  A higher p/e ratio should reflect greater expected future gains because of perceived growth opportunities and/or some competitive advantages and/or lesser risk, but at the same time it indicates that the share price is relatively more expensive.During periods where markets are out of equilibrium, for example during a bubble, high p/e ratios may also reflect over-optimism and over-pricing. Conversely, a lower p/e ratio can reflect either poorer future opportunities or potentially a bargain if the market is over-pessimistic or if one believes the market is not taking into account potential restructuring or a takeover that would improve future prospects.The P/E ratio, like other pricing ratios such as the price/book, price/sales or price/cash flows, is often used in valuing firms or takeover targets by finding the p/e ratio of a set of comparable companies and applying it to the target s current or forecasted earnings.Unfortunately, there are a variety of p/e ratios used by investors so care must be taken when comparing p/e ratios across firms. While price is generally the most current share price observed on the market, it can sometimes be the price observed at the company s year-end.Earnings can either be the:- historical earnings (the last reported yearly earnings) sometimes called the trailing p/e ratio; - forecasted earnings generating what is often called the forward or prospective p/e ratio (financial analysts generally forecast at least next year s earnings);- rolling earnings number - the sum of the last four quarterly earnings reported.ExampleOften cited when looking at long term trends, Robert Shiller of Yale University calculates a cyclically adjusted p/e ratio (CAPE) which is the ratio of stock prices to the moving average of the previous 10 years  earnings, deflated by the consumer price index.

price/earnings ratio,"A company's share price divided by the amount of profits it makes for each share in a 12-month period. PE ratios are normally calculated on the base of all the profit made in the period, whether or not the profit is paid out to shareholders in that period. [1] PE ratio, P/E ratio or PER for short, this is a company's share price divided by its earnings per share (EPS), expressed as a number or as a multiple of EPS (P/E multiple). The earnings used for the calculation can be either the amount most recently reported by the company, or an analyst's projection of future earnings (normally the current year or the year after that). An important indication of comparative value - investors are normally better off buying a stock with a low P/E ratio than one with a high ratio, as they are getting more earnings for their money.

principal/agent problem," The problem of motivating one party (the agent) to act on behalf of another (the principal) is known as the principal-agent problem, or agency problem for short.  Agency problems arise in a variety of different contexts. For example, a lawyer is meant to act in the best interest of his or her client; managers act on behalf of shareholders; employees work for their employers; politicians represent their voters and so on. Agency problems arise when the incentives between the agent and the principal are not perfectly aligned and conflicts of interest arise. As a result the agent may be tempted to act in his or her own interest rather the principal s. Conflicts of interest are almost inevitable. For example, the agent bears the full cost of putting effort into the task delegated by the principal, but usually does not receive the full benefit that results from these efforts. This may create an incentive for the agent to put in less effort into the task than he or she would do if acting on his or her own behalf. Similarly, traders or managers may take on excessive risk if they enjoy the benefits of doing so (a high bonus in case of success), but not the costs (shareholders and lenders losing a lot of money in case of failure). This type of 'moral hazard' is particularly relevant to the banking and insurance industry, and arises because the agent s actions that lead to the increase in risk are not publicly observable. Why can the agent get away with not acting in the best interest of the principal  A first possible explanation is that the cost to the principal of removing or punishing the agent is too high relative to the benefit. For example, a politician may get away with corruption during his term in office because in some environments it may be too costly for dispersed voters to undertake actions to remove the politician from office. A second, more widely applicable, explanation is the presence of information asymmetry. Information asymmetry arises when one party (the agent) is better informed than the other (the principal). Information asymmetry makes it difficult or even impossible for principals to know whether the agent acts in their best interest, especially if crucial variables (such as the agent s effort or competence) are unobservable. For example, if a company reports disappointing earnings figures then it may be difficult for shareholders to judge whether managers are to blame (incompetence or laziness) or whether the poor results are due to adverse factors beyond managers' control (economic recession, bad luck...). How can agency costs be mitigated  Most mechanisms focus on aligning the incentives between the principal and the agent through carrots and sticks. Some mechanisms are aimed at reducing the degree of information asymmetry. Examples of aligning the incentives include employee ownership schemes, executive stock options and profit sharing schemes - all carrots - and dismissal, or criminal prosecution of fraud - sticks. Examples of reducing information assymmetry include the compulsory provision of company accounts; auditing and monitoring; and legal disclosure requirements. Example The Enron scandal revealed in 2001 led to the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation and the dissolution of Arthur Andersen. Many executives at Enron were indicted for a variety of charges and sent to prison. In the wake of the Enron scandal new legislation (such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) was issued to improve investor protection and to increase the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies.

The use of pro forma earnings, which are published alongside GAAP numbers, is controversial since it gives companies greater freedom to present their figures in a way they choose, and the figures are not audited.

procure,To obtain something that is needed for a particular task. [1] 
procurement," Procurement helps ensure the  supply  in a supply chain.  Also termed supply management or purchasing, procurement is concerned with the broad task of coordinating the inbound flow of materials - including supplier selection, risk management and material planning and control. The purpose of procurement is to ensure that supplies of goods and services are in place so that a company can produce its products and ship them to its customers. Tactically, procurement also contributes to basic value drivers - such as price competitiveness and service levels. Strategically, procurement holds the potential to accelerate innovation and drive step changes in costs and performance levels. Example Procurement has traditionally been tasked with buying goods and services at the cheapest price.  Since companies typically spend some 60 to 80 per cent of their cost of sales on bought-in goods and services, this is not surprising.  But cost savings are not the only contribution that procurement can make. When an assembly plant relies on just in time deliveries to maintain production at low levels of inventory, reliability is as important.  The Seat car plant at Martorell near Barcelona has a supplier park 2km down the road, which delivers major modules like the cockpit  just in sequence  to the assembly line. Suppliers are instructed only a few hours beforehand the exact configuration (colour, left- or right-hand drive, instruments, etc) of the module, so they must have reliable processes in place to be able to respond so quickly. Avoiding the risk of discontinued supply, interruptions to supply and supplier bankruptcies are examples of other contributions that procurement can make.  This means taking additional aspects of a supplier s capability than price performance into account   such as financial stability, technical capability and quality performance, This is achieved by rating suppliers on several criteria, a process called vendor rating.  The aim is to jointly improve supplier and customer processes. Ethical sourcing - obtaining goods from sustainable raw materials using socially responsible methods   is another important area where procurement has a major role to play. Following a consumer backlash in its mature markets, sports goods supplier Nike and others worked with local authorities to eliminate the use of child labour at suppliers in Pakistan.  The main local supplier became Saga Sports, who established factories which banned the use of child labour, and the outsourcing practices which had allowed it to flourish. [1] "

product withdrawal,
product-harm crisis,"A highly publicised event caused by a product being found to be defective, contaminated or even harmful to consumers. The crisis could affect the entire product category or a subset of the category. In many cases, the crisis triggers a product recall on a voluntary basis or forced upon the affected company or companies by government regulators. In today's 'flat world', product-harm crises are often global. Short-term effects of a crisis are lost sales and the costs associated with product recalls. In the long term, the incident can severely damage the reputation of the affected brand and company. The key challenge for companies faced with a crisis is to restore consumer trust. Example China's 2008 milk scandal stemmed from milk being spiked with melamine. The potentially lethal chemical was added to artificially boost the protein level of milk. Babies fed on contaminated infant formula suffered kidney damage; at least six infants in China reportedly died. Though initially the crisis centered on Sanlu, the leading pre-crisis infant formula brand, many other Chinese brands were tainted by the scandal, including Yashili and Mengniu. Even today, most Chinese mothers still avoid domestic infant formula brands and prefer paying a premium for foreign brands. A very similar crisis occurred in 2007 in the pet food category when scores of pet food brands were recalled worldwide following reports of kidney failure among dogs and cats. The affected brands had sourced melamine contaminated wheat gluten from a Chinese supplier. [1] See Article: Chinese parents parents panic over tainted milk "

property market value,"Property valuations around the world used to be based on different definitions but the global property valuation profession has come together in recent years to formulate a standard set of definitions.  The most frequently used definition of value is market value.  It is defined in both global and UK property valuation standards as:  The estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm s-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.  [1] This valuation basis represents the current exchange value of the property if placed on a similar market as exists today but was placed on that market long enough ago to be properly marketed and the best price obtained as at the valuation date.  In an attempt to get a current market price for an asset that takes time to transact, the definition has to be somewhat contrived.  As it is an exchange value it has no shelf life but sometimes users of valuations presume that it does.  Sometimes commentators use words such as forced sale value when actually what they are describing is the situation where banks sell off foreclosed properties quickly.  The sale is not  forced  but is actually also a market value, but with the special assumption that it has a restricted marketing period which can lead to a lower realisation price. Example  This basis of value is most commonly used to value commercial property for secured bank lending purposes in both international and UK markets.  Despite this, the recent (2011) Independent Commission on Banking has virtually ignored the role market valuation played in bank lending in the period leading up to the financial crisis.  There are alternative definitions that would have indentified the over-pricing in commercial property markets and reduced the level of exposure to the subsequent property market crash, if applied and used properly.

proprietary trading,"When a bank, brokerage or other financial institution trades on its own account rather than on behalf of a customer.  [1] In simple terms, proprietary or prop trading is where a trading desk, using the bank's own capital and balance sheet, carries out trades in various instruments, often for speculative purposes.They can be ordinary shares and bonds traded on exchanges, but are more often derivatives - either exchange-traded or in the over-the-counter markets - or foreign exchange. ExampleSo-called ""pure"" proprietary trading is where traders trade for the bank's own profit, unrelated to client business. These traders are generally ""walled off"" from the rest of the bank, and generate only a portion of total trading revenues.  The other type of trading banks do is to help clients carry out trades, where the desk will use the bank's own capital to make a market in a certain instrument, offering itself as a buyer to a client that wants to sell, or a seller to a client that wants to buy.Known as ""flow business"", this is not speculative trading by the banks. Yet, to a certain extent, it still puts the bank's own capital at risk, sometimes in as significant a way as if it were conducting its own speculative prop trading.

proxy access,"Directors of public corporations are nominated and elected each year through a process called  proxy voting.   Nominations for director are listed on a piece of paper called the  proxy,  which is mailed to all shareholders.  They usually receive one vote for every share they own.  The nominations for directors, however, are not made by the shareholders themselves.  Instead, the nominating and governance committee of the board   sometimes in consultation with management   selects the nominees. In theory the board best knows the specific qualifications and expertise that are required to fill a vacancy.  Critics of this system advocate that the rules be changed so that major shareholders be given the right to make their own nominations.  This is known as  proxy access.   Rules for proxy access are currently being considered in many countries. In the U.S. this has been assigned to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Dodd-Frank Bill of 2010. ExampleWhy is proxy access important   Advocates of proxy access believe that because the board of directors serves as the representatives of shareholders, shareholders should have the right to nominate their own representatives. Critics of proxy access believe that a change in the rules would make it easier for activist investors and special interests to gain access to the board.  If the board is  co-opted,  it could make decisions that favor the interests of one shareholder or stakeholder group over another and hurt the competitive advantage of the company.  [1]"

public trust in business,"Public trust in business is the degree to which the public believes that business will act in a particular manner because the business has included the public s interest into its own. It is a critical ingredient for social cooperation and market efficiency and a cause for deep concern when it is absent or threatened. For example, the public trusts business or a business to produce useful, safe, and reliable goods and services because business is an enterprise that is most successful when it incorporates social values not only in the products and services it creates, but also in its daily practice. Today, a large portion of the public believes that the majority of its vulnerability in business relationships is not voluntary but rather results from a sizable power imbalance that enables executives and companies to assume far less risk than the average person. This sense has been exacerbated by the global financial crisis, in which taxpayers have been called upon to shore up institutions whose risky behaviour put financial systems at risk.ExampleThe sale of baby food is a great example of public trust in business. Parents will only purchase baby food if they believe that the company whose brand is on the product shares their interest in the well-being of their child. The brand on the product is actually a proxy for the entire responsibility chain - farmers, processors, distributors, and the store where the product is purchased. [1]"

put up or shut up,"This is the term for a ruling from the UK Takeover Panel. If a potential buyer for a company is thinking of making an offer, but is not yet in a position to make a firm bid, and the approach is unwelcome to the target company, the target can ask the Panel to impose a deadline to clarify the potential bidder's intentions. If the potential bidder ""puts up"" it makes a firm offer: if it ""shuts up"" it must say it has no intention to bid and this normally bars it from making an offer for six months. [1] ExampleThe ""put up or shut up"" order is one of the best weapons available to a besieged UK company, but knowing when to use it calls for sound judgment: too soon and shareholders may miss an attractive offer for their company; too late and a company could be damaged following months of uncertainty. The ""put up or shut up"" Takeover Panel rule is designed to stop predators besieging companies for an indefinite period of time. It requires a potential bidder either to make an offer to shareholders or walk away for a period of six months. [2] ViewUK Takeover PanelCadbury tries to force Kraft's hand"

qualitative research,"A type of market research, especially in the form of interviews or group discussions, that aims to find out people's attitudes or opinions about something, where the results cannot be shown in numbers. [1] "
quality-adjusted house prices,"The prices of homes are influenced by their internal and external features and location, which altogether are termed their 'quality'. Within any housing market, homes of different qualities are likely to be traded over time. This can lead to severe biases in house price indices based on the average values of properties traded.  Two common approaches to quality-adjustment are repeat sales and hedonic models. In repeat sales indices, only the prices of properties with known previously traded values are included. In hedonic-based indices, values are estimated for specific property attributes and aggregated. Both approaches have strengths and weaknesses but are a great improvement on the average approach. Simple repeat sales indices exclude new property and have sample selection biases. Hedonic indices may miss out important variables necessary to adjust quality. Example Examples of repeat-sales indices are the Case-Schiller index of US cities and the Land Registry house price index for England and Wales. Examples of the hedonic approach are the Halifax house price index for the UK and the Notaires-INSEE index in France. Because of 'quality' effects, when investing in residential property it should not be assumed that the price performance of the residential asset in question will be accurately measured by the available house price indices.

quant fund,"Quant funds are funds that use quantitative analysis using computer-based models to inform their decisions on whether to buy or sell securities. Quant strategies are often used by hedge funds. They offer de-correlation benefits in that managers are not stock picking and instead are relying on a computer's dispassionate assessment of price and value criteria. Quant hedge funds sometimes use CTA (commodity trading adviser) or managed futures strategies which attracted a good deal of attention during 2008. In that year, while nearly every investment strategy failed, CTAs rose 17 per cent.   quant funds in the news In June 2013 it was report that some of the world's biggest quant hedge funds had suffered steep losses in the previous two weeks following a sell-off in US bond markets. Many quant funds had been major buyers of bonds as their algorithms had followed yields lower over the preceding years. Winton, the world s largest quant fund, managed to sidestep the worst of the losses becasue it had diversified its algorithmic trading programmes into equities and away from the traditional focus in futures contracts."
quantative easing,Correct spelling is quantitative easing.  
quantify,"To measure something and express it as a number, especially something that is difficult to measure. [1] "
quantitative,Connected with amounts rather than with the quality or nature of something. [1] 
quantitative analyst,"Quantitative analysts (or 'quants') are individuals in the financial services industry that combine skills across several disciplines to help quantify the effects of numerous economic and financial factors on the performance of various financial instruments. A quantitative analyst typically combines information and techniques from economic theory, accounting, statistics, computer programming, and information technology in order to identify the proper value for a financial instrument such as a stock, bond, derivative, or other security.  Quantitative analysts are typically employed by investment banks and money managers such as hedge funds and mutual funds. Example A quantitative analyst could work for a hedge fund manager that specialises in trading mortgage-backed securities and other bond-like instruments. This analyst of a mortgage-backed security would use financial models and large amounts of data on trends in housing prices, interest rates, borrowers  income and debt loads, the growth in the overall economy, and any other salient factors to estimate the riskiness and magnitude of the cash flows that are expected to be generated by this security.  This analysis will then lead to an estimated value for the security which can provide useful information that the hedge fund manager can use to decide whether or not to buy, sell, or avoid this security.

quantitative easing,"Central banks normally set the price of money using official interest  rates to regulate the economy. These interest rates radiate out to the  rest of the economy. They affect the cost of loans paid by companies,  the cost of mortgages for households and the return on saving money.  Higher interest rates make borrowing less attractive because taking out a  loan becomes more expensive. They also make saving more attractive,  demand and spending reduces. Lower interest rates have the reverse  effect. But interest rates cannot be cut below zero and when official rates  get close to zero the effect they have on regulating the economy becomes  muted. Banks still need to make a profit and in troubled times the gap  between the official interest rate and the rates faced by companies and  households can rise, because lenders want a greater return for the  additional risk of granting a loan when times are tough. When interest rates are close to zero there is another way of  affecting the price of money: Quantitative Easing (QE). The aim is still  to bring down interest rates faced by companies and households and the  most important step in QE is that the central bank creates new money for  use in an economy. Only a central bank can do this because its money is accepted as  payment by everybody.  Sometimes dubbed incorrectly ""printing money"" a  central bank simply creates new money at the stroke of a computer key,  in effect increasing the credit in its own bank account. It can then use this new money to buy whatever assets it likes:  government bonds, equities, houses, corporate bonds or other assets from  banks. With the central bank weighing in, the price of the assets it  buys should rise and the yield, or interest rate, on that asset will  fall. Companies for example with a willing central bank seeking to buy  its bond, will be able to pay a lower interest rate when new bonds are  issued or existing bonds come to the end of their life and need to be  replaced. With cheaper borrowing the hope is that the central bank will again  encourage greater spending, putting additional demand into the economy  and pulling it out of recession. As the money ends up in bank deposits,  banks should also find their funding position improved and make them  more willing to lend. A side effect will be that this new money is expected to raise  consumer prices giving people another incentive to buy now rather than  later. Of course there are risks. First, a central bank can lose money on  its purchases, money that will ultimately have to be underwritten by  taxpayers either with higher future taxation or by the central bank  creating more money and risking higher future inflation. Second, go too  far with creating and spending money and you will destroy the value of  the currency. Inflation or even hyperinflation is the result. Third, if a  descent into QE destroys confidence in an economy rather than gives  reassurance that the authorities are on the case it can be  counter-productive. That is why central banks cannot use QE willy-nilly, but if you are  not aggressive enough QE simply will not work to change other interest  rates in the economy and stimulate demand. The trouble is, because the  policy is unorthodox and the situation is dramatic no one knows how much  QE is too much and how much is not enough.

quantum computing,"Quantum computing  promises to transform information technology over the next few decades, as electronic computing reaches the limits of what is physically possible with conventional chips and circuitry. The empirical observation called Moore's Law predicts that more and more transistors can be packed in microprocessors over time, meaning that computing power can continue to increase while chips continue to shrink in size. This implies that computers can perform a series of operations in exponentially shorter periods of time. However, this miniaturisation of electronics is limited by the laws of physics. If Moore's Law were to hold, in a few years, one would need to have transistors the size of an atom, which is naturally impossible. This limit in computational power can be overcome if computers could perform multiple computations simultaneously.  The theory behind the quantum computer is to use atoms, instead of silicon chips, to process data at a faster speed than today's computers. Quantum computing is based on the concept in physics that sub-atomic particles can be in more than one place at once. In quantum computing the digital binary code of either 1 or zero, representing on and off, is replaced by quantum computing qubits which not only allow the state of neither one nor zero to exist but also permit the idea that a value could be both 1 and zero and all points between simultaneously. The idea is that, freed of its ""either-or"" constraint that a quantum computer could be much faster than a super computer. Quantum computing is still in its early stages of development and is still trying to overcome the problem that if you look at subatomic particles you could bump into them and thereby change their value.   Quantum computing in the news In February 2014 a writer in the FT attempted to provide a round up of where the world had got to with quantum computing. The writer poinnted out that although Google and Nasa had jointly invested $10m on a prototype quantum computer from D-Wave Systems, that there remained a simmering debate on whether the computers were quantum at all, despite observable quantum effects."

rapidly developing economy multinationals,"These are multinational enterprises from developing countries. Much of the world s economic growth is occurring in the rapidly developing economies (RDE) such as Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, and others. MNEs (multinational enterprises) from the developed economies have flooded these markets. However, as a result, in the last few years we have seen a new phenomena, MNEs from the RDEs are returning the favour and are increasingly active on the world stage. For decades multinationals from the developed world invested foreign direct investment (FDI) in the developing economies. The flows were mainly one way, knowledge, capital and expatriate employees went in the direction of the developing economies. In the last decade we have seen the growth of a much more two way relationship between the rapidly developing economies (RDEs) and the developed economies. One of the new phenomena is a range of low cost products, as a result of what the late C.K. Prahalad called the customer at the bottom of the pyramid, designed for the millions of lower income customers in the RDEs being adopted in the developing economies.  The other is the rise of MNEs from the RDEs, particularly China, India and Brazil. Many of these firms are now global players that have not only substantive operations based in their home countries but also operate in the developed economies. What has been a surprise to many is how fast they have risen through the ranks of global players. In just two years, from 2006 to 2008, the number of Brazilian, Chinese, Indian and Russian MNEs on the FT Global 500 more than quadrupled from 15 to 62, in September 2010 there were 80.  ExampleIn the 2010 version of the FT Global 500 for the first time, a Chinese company, PetroChina, has overtaken Exxon Mobil as the world s most valuable company, of the 500 firms over 100 were from RDEs.  Not only are they competing on low price but increasingly on innovative products, some as result of products for the customers at the  base of the pyramid  but also from burgeoning R&D; labs. India outsourcing giant Wipro, started out as a vegetable oil trading company in Western India. In the late 1970s, when IBM left India, Wipro first entered the IT sector. In the early 1990s, Wipro set its sights on the markets outside of India.By 2010 it had close to 110,000 employees, a global footprint, and had become one of the largest IT companies in the world. It now competes on equal footing with other global IT firms from the developed economies. Embraer is also a good example of a firm that has taken flight from its  base in Brazil to become the fourth largest civil plane maker in the world. It started out in 1969 as a government owned corporation that focused exclusively on the local market. After being privatized in 1994 it put considerable effort into the small commercial market place and soon followed with regional jets. They also turned their attention more on world markets outside of their home country.  Today they are seen as one of the four key players in the civil aviation market along with American Boeing, European giant Airbus and Canada s Bombardier.  [1]"
raroc,"Risk adjusted return on capital (raroc): A way of measuring profitability that takes into account the riskiness of an activity. Specifically, raroc is often measured as a ratio. On the top is the expected revenue from a project minus the expected expenses, the expected losses and return from investing the same amount of capital in something with no risks. The bottom of the ratio is the amount of capital the firm plans to use in the project. The idea was popularised by Bankers Trust in the late 1970s and 1980s and banks use it to help determine how to allocate their capital among different activities.  [1]"
rarorac,"Risk adjusted return on risk adjusted capital (rarorac) combines both raroc and rorac to create an easy yardstick for comparing the relative risks and returns of various activities. But its accuracy depends on the models used to estimate risk and capital, such as Value at Risk. This measure became popular after the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision began requiring banks to apply risk adjustments to the way they calculated their capital stock. Rorac is often used when the risk varies depending on the kind of capital invested. In the 2007-8 financial crisis, many banks found that their estimates had understated the risks they were running, particularly in complex structured products.  [1]"
rat race,The unpleasant situation in business or in life in which people are always struggling to compete against each other for success. [1] 
ratable,"A ratable share can be something such as a payment that can be calculated by a formula such as the amount someone owes or is owed, relative to the amounts other people owe or are owed. Ratable can also mean an amount derived at by applying a percentage calculation. In this respect the term is used to describe an asset that can have can have tax charged on it.  Ratable  is a controversial term in sovereign debt when combined with the term pari passu (equal footing). In this case a decision to make an equal 'ratable payment' would mean a decision to pay each creditor the same percentage of the amount they originally lent, instead of one creditor having a preferred status over the other.   ratable payment in the news In 2012 a group of bondholders who had refused to take the massive haircut offered after Argentina defaulted on its bonds in 2001, demanded that they receive the same treatment as bondholders who did. A judge ruled that they should be treated pari passu and be entitled to the same ratable payment as those who accepted the exchange bonds. In other words if Argentina intended to repay the exchange bond holders in full then it should also repay those who refused to accept the hair-cut (the hold-outs) in full.  Argentina vowed not to pay the hold-outs and it was unclear in February 2013 whether an appeal lodged by Argentina would be successful."

rating,See credit rating
rating agencies,"Rating agencies, or credit rating agencies, evaluate the creditworthiness of organisations that issue debt in public markets.  This includes the debts of corporations, nonprofit organisations, and governments, as well as  securitised assets    which are assets that are bundled together and sold as a security to investors.  Rating agencies assign a letter grade to each bond, which represents an opinion as to the likelihood that the organisation will be able to repay both the principal and interest as they become due. Ratings are made on a descending scale: AAA is the highest, then AA, A, BBB, BB, B, etc.  A rating of BB or below is considered a  junk bond,  because it is likely to default.  Many factors go into the assignment of ratings, including the profitability of the organisation and its total indebtedness.  The three largest credit rating agencies are Moody s, Standard & Poor s, and Fitch Ratings. ExampleThere are very few AAA rated companies in the world.  Examples include ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, and Microsoft.  The governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany are also rated AAA.  Organisations with a AAA rating are able to issue debt at very low interest rates. There are many companies with low credit ratings.  General Motors had a  junk  credit rating for many years before it declared bankruptcy in 2009.  Companies with a low credit rating generally pay a much higher interest rate on their debt, and may find it difficult to sell new bonds.   The methodology of the ratings agencies is not without flaws, and they are under considerable scrutiny regarding the inaccuracy of many ratings categories during the financial crisis. [1]"

rating feedback effects,"Rating downgrades often severely increase a company's immediate cost of debt. Debt becomes costly due to regulatory restrictions that limit investors' holdings of lower rated debt or because of rating-based pricing in loan or bond contracts. The increase in credit costs, however, reduces the firm s creditworthiness so that the initial rating change has a feedback effect that further impairs the firm s credit quality. At the extreme, this may result in a death-spiral in which a rating downgrade triggers a firm s default. Example While Enron experienced major problems throughout 2001, its rating remained  investment grade  until November 28. Four days later, Enron filed for bankruptcy. This extreme decline in creditworthiness was partly due to rating feedback effects: Since Enron had a vast amount of debt capital related to rating triggers, the downgrade from investment-grade to junk-bond status caused massive liquidity problems that eventually sealed Enron's fate. [1]"
rating review,"A rating review, also known as rating watch, watch list or Credit Watch, indicates a future rating change. It represents a credit rating agency's opinion on the development of a credit rating over the next three months. Rating reviews give a stronger indication of future rate changes than credit outlooks. Typically, review listings are invoked by major corporate events, such as the announcement of a merger or acquisition, or the change of a corporation's strategy. During the review listing, the agency usually interacts with the company and collects additional information. The watchlist is eventually resolved by the announcement of a rating change or a rating confirmation. The rating review seems to be an effective instrument to urge borrowers with weak credit quality to abstain from further risk shifting. A rating review is announced solely at the discretion of the credit rating agency.  A given rating maybe reviewed by the agency but not announced publicly as some reviews could be just routine.Credit rating agencies aim to conclude listed reviews within 90 days, which gives time to clarify the impact of an announcement. Example While the stock market reacts strongly negative to direct rating downgrades (a median loss of 9.4% following Moody s rating downgrades over the period 1991 to 2004), the reaction to watchlist-preceded downgrades is much weaker (-1.7%). This confirms the monitoring role of credit rating agencies over and above their general role as information providers. [1]"

razor blades strategy,"A razor blade strategy or razor blade business model is one that relies on selling the primary product cheaply, or giving it away or even selling it at a loss, but its replaceable parts, that need replacing frequently, at a good profit. The term is derived from an article in Time magazine published in 1927. In it the writer at the time referred to King Gillette's razor with disposable blades invention and said that Gillette made its real profits from the high margin on the blades   a version of events that has been dismissed as a myth, but that still gave birth to the term. The term razor blade strategy is frequently used to describe the home printer market. The actual printer is sold cheaply but the cost of replacement inks can be almost as much, or sometimes exceed, the cost of a printer.   razor blades strategy in the news In April 2010 an FT writer commented that it looked as though Apple had found a way to reverse the razor and blade strategy favoured by Warren Buffett with an iPhone which was enjoying strong demand despite its very high price. Also in April 2010 a writer commented that although he was aware that the inkjet printer market had embraced the razor-blade sales model of cheap hardware and expensive consumables that he was shocked to discover that the home office laser printers were following the same route."

This means that, in effect, you will only have been paid 2 per cent for the lending risk.   real interest rates in the news In June 2014 a writer on the FT's economics and markets blog rejected the idea that real interest rates were likely to remain low in the world's developed economies. Contrary to the the view that real interest rates are correlated to growth, he said evidence showed this not to be the case. "
real ledger,A ledger showing amounts relating to property and equipment. [1] 
real options reasoning,"An approach to managing projects under uncertainty that implicitly accounts for the ability of managers to alter and improve these projects as technological and market conditions change. For example, by purchasing a plot of land near its factory now, a firm gains the real option of expanding its factory later.  In determining whether or not to purchase the land, the firm should account for this real option value. Real options reasoning is a heuristic based on the logic of financial options.  A heuristic is just a rule of thumb by which one makes a quick decision in a complex environment.  The real options heuristic is managers  recognition that flexibility is valuable, which allows them to choose project decisions that acknowledge this value, even though they cannot precisely calculate its value. This heuristic is based on the logic of financial options in that financial options are contracts that create valuable flexibility; if you have a financial option, you have the flexibility to purchase, or sell, something at a pre-specified price at a later date, or to go with the market price at that future date.  Like financial options, investments in real assets can provide firms the option to take an action at a later date if conditions are favourable, or to abandon further investment if conditions prove unfavourable. Example Many investment opportunities entail real option value.  However, unlike financial options, there is no objective market for most real options.  To set a price for a financial option, there are a set of variables for which values must be known. Once these values are agreed, a price can be set and two parties can agree a contract - the option of selling/ buying something at a particular price at a specific future date, and the right to do this granted for a specific price (the option premium). For real options, it is typically not possible to establish these values, nor is it possible to establish a contract.  For example, corporate social responsibility is sometimes characterised as containing real option value. That is, if a manufacturer invests in, say, building a community centre, the goodwill it engenders may earn the firm some flexibility with local regulators, and later it may be allowed to expand its manufacturing facilities. However, it is unlikely that this goodwill will be in the form of a contract, nor is it clear how much that goodwill is worth at the time the decision is made to build the community centre.  Rather, managers know that there probably is some such value, and they factor this notion, though somewhat vague, into their decision-making. Thus, real options reasoning is best used as a heuristic and not as an explicit valuation tool. [1]"

recession,"[1]A marked contraction in economic activity. There is little agreement on a definition, but a recession is often associated with at least two consecutive quarters of declining GDP or the verification that one exists by an august body such as the National Bureau of Economic Research in the US. A global recession is often thought to be a situation when global GDP growth falls below 2 per cent.    Recession in the news The fallout from the global financial crisis of 2008/2009 plunged much of the developed world into a deep recession. Demand for goods and services declined, which had a knock-on effect on companies. Unemployment grew and investment stalled. With tax revenues declining, government borrowing also grew and attempts to rectify weak public finances exacerbated the crisis particularly in the so-called peripheral eurozone countries of Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland. Austerity measures were adopted across Europe and the US and were made a condition of further lending to many of the worst affected countries such as Greece. Monetary policy across advanced economies in recession was loosened aggressively with sharp cuts in interest rates to historic lows and unorthodox policies such as quantitative easing in the US and UK and long-term cheap lending to banks in the eurozone. All such monetary policy measures were aimed at stimulating economic activity in their countries and lifting them out of recession. At the beginning of January 2013 there were fears that many advanced economies would be disappointed by the growth rate.[2]    FT articles and indepth pages that cover recession  Euro in crisis Europe burnt and abandoned Economic outlook: Central banks' caution Ending the recession quickly is too narrow a goal The US adopts Britain's economic strategy       "

red team,"A red team is an inside group that explicitly challenges a company's strategy, products, and preconceived notions.  It frames a problem from the perspective of an adversary or sceptic, to find gaps in plans, and to avoid blunders.  Red teams are one way to manage the biggest corporate risk of all: thoughtlessness. The term red team comes from the cold war practice of using US officers taking a Soviet, ie  red  perspective. (Moscow did the same thing and called it a  blue team. )  US officers would  think red , to attempt to defeat US plans and systems, rather than mirror image US thinking onto the Soviets.  For example, the US Navy used a red team to try to defeat its own submarine force using Soviet concepts and technology. Today, red teams are used to double check important assumptions and overcome groupthink.  The CIA used a red team to challenge both the intelligence and plan for the attack on Osama bin Laden in Pakistan.  An insurance company hires plaintiff attorneys to critique their insurance contracts prior to their issue.  Following the collapse of Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, the big four accounting firms established what, in effect, were ambassadors in Washington, senior partners whose job it was to think like a regulatory agency, Congress, or some other branch of government. In the UK, the Department of Works and Pensions uses a red team to monitor welfare reforms. The common feature in all of these examples is the adversary's or sceptic's outlook taken on by an independent group.  This shift in perspective recognises the powerful psychological force that exists in all organisations not to challenge the way problems are framed   something that can lead to disaster.  Arthur Andersen decentralised risk management to its Houston, Texas, ie Enron, office.  Its Chicago headquarters had no independent view of the risks they were taking on, nor did headquarters appreciate the depth of the reaction of regulators and politicians to Enron's collapse. A red team is especially useful to review decisions with large scale and complexity.  This is because the momentum needed to launch such projects can lead to a feeling that team loyalty requires supporting them, and because the tendency to get lost in the many details leads people to overlook project risks as a whole.  Segways (the two-wheel personal transportation device) and Windows 8 would have benefited greatly from red team review.  Red teams also are useful to break out of the most dangerous bubble of all, the tendency of senior management to be detached from field operations (as Arthur Andersen was) and the realities of global business. Red teams are very useful at the tactical level as well.  Technology giants like Microsoft and Apple use red teams to try to hack their own software, knowing that if they relied on software producers to judge this they would overlook many holes and vulnerabilities. Despite their value, red teams are difficult to use.  They need to be more than window dressing, a mere rubber stamp approval of premade decisions.  Another problem is that the red team may not truly capture the thinking of an adversary.  Team members may simply impute the way they would frame a problem to a competitor.  Many US firms find it difficult to understand the way Chinese companies think.  One sees this in US legalistic challenges to intellectual property disputes.  Red teams that try to ""think Chinese"" are necessary in today's global markets. Getting the right people on a red team is important.  Creativity, trust, and good communication skills are vital. So are clear authority lines to ensure that the red team doesn't report to a  department that has a clear interest in promoting the strategy under review. A final example of red teams should be kept in mind.  ""Free"" red teaming may come from government  bodies.  The US Congress may launch hearings about corporate malfeasance and call in critics to testify.  The Justice Department, SEC, or Serious Fraud Office is more than willing to ""red team"" corporate corruption, with enormous damage to a company's reputation.  So one final reason to use a red team is that if a company doesn't do so, the authorities may be only too happy to do it for them.[1]"

reflective action,"The process of exercising leadership by  thinking on your feet  in an unfamiliar setting by applying previous knowledge to a current environmental assessment in order to address a challenge presented in a new situation. Some methods of learning provide students with all the information necessary to solve a particular challenge. However, real world problems are messy. For those types of problems, reasonable people would disagree on how the problem should be articulated as well as how it could be solved. Training managers to expect that the right solution can be found creates a false belief that lots of data presented in just the right way is necessary in order to make decisions. Important decisions are often made with less than optimal information in less than ideal conditions. Reflective action articulates the behaviours of managers that consciously assess and synthesise available data, while simultaneously reflecting on and drawing from professional and other life experiences in order to make sound decisions.  Action learning is an effective method of developing reflective action skills. [1]"

regime uncertainty,"Regime uncertainty refers to the pervasive uncertainty that investors face over the security of their property rights and the income it yields. It was pioneered by Robert Higgs as an explanation for the duration of the Great Depression - he argued that Roosevelt s policies led to a significant reduction in investors  confidence regarding the durability of the capitalist system, causing private investment (and thus economic output) to remain below potential. In short, people hold off on long-term decisions when there is uncertainty over the rules of the game. Most economists acknowledge that confidence plays an important factor in determining investment, but the fact it is hard to quantify poses problems. People should be wary of policymakers that promise to increase confidence, since managing expectations is a complex, difficult task. Regime uncertainty puts meat on the bones of  animal spirits , suggesting that a clear and credible commitment to the security of property rights is crucial during a downturn. There is evidence of regime uncertainty during the recent financial crisis. When governments bailed out banks they provided temporary respite but severely undermined the stability of property rights. Investors were faced with a double burden of not only having to recalculate their potential returns in light of new economic conditions, but they also had to factor in potential government interventions. Policy can therefore have the unintended consequence of delaying the economic recovery. [1] Video Wall Street Rescue Blog post  FT Alphaville - Stylised facts from Bob and Kevin "

regionalisation,"Though multinational enterprises (MNEs) and other firms have been encouraged to adopt global strategies for a number of years, in practice, most firms do not operate globally, in the sense of conducting business in each major region of the world - the EU, North America and Asia.Instead they effectively adopt regional or local strategies   a process known as regionalisation.To explain this process, firms start off competing in their own country, many stop there.  Others go onto export and then set up foreign operations. Most firms start off with nearby countries, for Canadian firms the U.S. is a natural place to go.The next stage of growth is typically to expand within the region the home country is part of due to trade agreements and physical/cultural proximity.  After becoming a regional player some firms do adopt global strategies, research suggests that for even global firms their home region still remains the most important.For example, the world's 500 largest firms, measured by revenues and/or assets, have averaged 77% of their sales and 81% of their assets in their home region over the last 10 years.Only a handful of these firms - over 20 per cent - have significant operations in each of the three broad regions.  Despite globalisation rhetoric, business is actually largely regional. ExampleThough Walmart is the world s largest firm, by revenues, its North American operations represent the lion s share of its activities.  Europe is an interesting case for Walmart; the company does have some substantial operations in the U.K. through its acquisition of Asda, however it pulled out of Germany in 2006 leaving it essentially in only one European country.  It also operates in China, Japan and India but this is the extent of its operations in Asia.  Certainly, Walmart is a world leader in terms of size, but it operates in less than 20 countries.  [1]"

rehypothecation,"This is where collateral which has been posted by hedge funds against loans they have taken out is used by investment banks for their own purposes. [1] Rehypothecation is the practice of using the assets held as collateral for one client in transactions for another. [2]  This allows the prime broker to re-lend client securities held as collateral. [3] Like many other providers of broking services to hedge funds, the European arm of Lehman Brothers was fond of using collateral posted by its clients as collateral for activities of its own. The practice seemed harmless until the broker went bust, leaving hundreds of funds facing a long struggle to claw back assets. [4] Relatively standard practice for many prime brokers pre-Lehman Brothers, the investor was compensated by being offered lower cost of financing for money borrowed.  The practice has not disappeared, but asset managers are much more thoughtful about whether to allow it. [5]"

relative deflation,"Deflation occurs when the annual inflation rate falls below zero per cent. The term  relative deflation  is generally used to describe an economy with an inflation rate, which has not necessarily descended into negative territory, but is markedly lower than comparable economies. ExampleFor instance, Japan s economy is said to have suffered  relative deflation  in relation to its major trading partners during the 1990s. [1] "
relative performance evaluation (RPE),"An evaluation of an individual s performance that is based on the difference between an individual s measurable output and an aggregated amount of the same measurable output observed in a group of the individual s peers.  The main idea behind relative performance evaluation is that an individual should not be held responsible for risks and factors beyond the control of the individual.  Example An individual would not be held responsible for downturns in the individual s performance arising from uncontrollable factors such as natural catastrophes, general economic conditions, stock market volatility, and government regulation. Assuming peers are also affected by these same uncontrollable factors, then measuring the net performance (i.e., the difference between, for example, the individual s financial outcomes and the aggregated financial outcome from a group of peers) means that the individual can be evaluated as having performed well even if there is a weak financial outcome, as long as that weak financial outcome is better than the corresponding financial outcome from a composite of the individual s peer group. [1] The drawback of RPE is that it can encourage workers to engage in behaviour such as sabotaging the efforts of co-workers, collusion with co-workers to collectively shirk, and hiring inept co-workers to work on their teams. Relative performance evaluation contracts are not desirable when it is difficult to measure worker performance or when it is desirable for teams to work together. [2]"

relevant costs,"Expected future costs that differ among alternative courses of actions. In product deletion or outsourcing decisions, the relevant costs are typically those that are avoidable if the product or service is either outsourced or eliminated from an entity s offerings.

remunerate,To pay someone for work they have done. [1]

remuneration committee,"A remuneration committee is established to ensure that remuneration arrangements support the strategic aims of a business and enable the recruitment, motivation and retention of senior executives while also complying with the requirements of regulation. The remuneration committee should have delegated responsibility for setting remuneration for all executive directors and the chairman, including pension rights and any compensation payments. The committee should also recommend and monitor the level and structure of remuneration for senior management. The definition of senior management for this purpose should be determined by the board but should normally include the first layer of management below board level.   Example The UK Corporate Governance Code (2010) paid more attention to remuneration by arguing that ""levels of remuneration should be sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to run the company successfully, but a company should avoid paying more than is necessary for this purpose. A significant proportion of executive directors  remuneration should be structured so as to link rewards to corporate and individual performance."" To achieve these objectives a remuneration committee is required to be in place. The board should establish a remuneration committee of at least three, or in the case of smaller companies two, independent non-executive directors. In addition the company chairman may also be a member of, but not chair, the committee if he or she was considered independent on appointment as chairman. The remuneration committee should make available its terms of reference, explaining its role and the authority delegated to it by the board. Where remuneration consultants are appointed, a statement should be made available of whether they have any other connection with the company. Remuneration in many sectors, especially banking, was unfair and irresponsible as indicated in the UK House of Lords, raising the importance of remuneration committees in overseeing the fairness of such compensations.

renminbi,"Renminbi is the official name given to currency of the People's Republic of China. It means 'the people's currency'. It is equivalent to saying Sterling when referring to the UK's currency. Once in China the primary units of the currency are generally referred to as yuan or kwai, just as in UK one would refer to pounds. The abbreviated notification of the currency is RMB, but since the trade in offshore renminbi got underway the onshore trade in renminbi is usually referred to as CNY, to differentiate it from CNH, which refers to renminbi traded in Hong Kong. In February 2013 Taiwan became the second major market, after Hong Kong, to be able to clear renminbi trades. Renminbi traded in Taiwan are referred to as CNT.   renminbi in the news In October 2013 it was reported that London was strengthening its position as a global hub for offshore renminbi.

rent-seeking,"Rent-seeking is a culture in which the principal route to wealth is not creating wealth, but taking possession of or benefiting from wealth created by others. This takes many forms. On Europe s oldest highway, the Rhine river, the castles on rocky outcrops date from the time when bandits with aristocratic titles extracted tolls from passing traffic. In poor countries the focus of political and business life is often rent-seeking rather than wealth creation. That helps explain why some countries are rich and others poor. Rent-seeking can be effected through rake-offs on government contracts, or the appropriation of state assets by oligarchs and the relatives of politicians.

repertory grid technique,"Also known as rep grid, this is a very useful method from the field of psychology that can be used to uncover customers  perceptions of products and services and to identify their hidden needs. Customers are asked multiple times to compare and contrast random sets of three products or services which they are familiar with. Each set of three products is presented to them with the same question which is  In your experience, how are two of these products similar to each other and different from the third   This forces interviewees to think deeply and articulate their views on products or services. There is a full methodology to designing, conducting and analysing repertory grid interviews which is ideal for differentiating between what is most often stated by customers and what is really most important to them. Example Equant, the global IT services provider, used repertory grid technique to develop a deeper understanding of its customers  needs. Equant s service offering was contrasted against that of IT suppliers and other B2B service providers, such as financial auditors, data warehousing companies and office security service providers. This allowed Equant to enhance their service offering with ideas based on the insights from other sectors. [1]"

According to the report by court-appointed examiner Anton Valukas released in early 2010, Lehman engaged in what was referred to internally as  Repo 105 .

The seller pays an interest rate, called the repo rate, when buying back the securities. Example Central banks often use repos to boost money supply, buying Treasury bills or other government paper from commercial banks so the banks can boost their reserves, and selling the paper back at a later date. When the central bank wants to tighten money supply, it sells the paper first, and buys it back later - this is called a reverse repo, an agreement to lend securities rather than funds.

reputation commons problem,"A situation in which the reputation of a group of firms, typically an industry, is tarnished as a whole due to the actions of a single firm within the group.   Example Observers are sometimes unable or unwilling to distinguish the characteristics of one firm from similar other firms.  For example, BP s oil spill, in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, led to a moratorium on deep water drilling that affected other oil companies. In May 2010, US President Barack Obama ordered all 33 deepwater oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico to stop drilling and extended the moratorium on new deepwater wells. [1]"
reputational risk,"A company s reputation is perhaps its most valuable asset. Reputational risk is the possible loss of the organisation s reputational capital.  Imagine that the company has an account similar to a bank account that they are either filling up or depleting.  Every time the company does something good, its reputational capital account goes up; every time the company does something bad, or is accused of doing something bad, the account goes down. The commercial bank examination, which is a supervisory manual published by the Federal Reserve Board in the US to provide guidance in bank inspections, defines reputational risk as the potential loss in reputational capital based on either real or perceived losses in reputational capital. In fact, the manual states very clearly that a company can lose its reputation whether allegations are true or not. Some corporations try to understand what the potential risks are to the company s reputation and either prepare crisis management responses or solutions. Many of the leading experts in the field of communication and strategy believe that being able to assess and manage a company s reputational risk is one way to attain a competitive edge, especially in an increasingly negative global business environment as shown in polls describing people's feelings toward business, such as the Edelman Trust Barometer. Example The pharmaceutical company, Merck knew that side effects from the drug Vioxx could lead to heart problems in some patients. In fact, after the company faced law suits related to the complications from taking this drug, a memo was discovered showing that executives within the company knew about the side effects and had warned senior managers about the dangers associated with taking Vioxx in some patients. These warnings were ignored. If the company had understood the risk to its reputation, it would have understood that in the long term, the money it was making selling the drug was not worth the potential loss in reputational capital to the organisation as a whole.

From 1 April 2016 RDEC will replace the tax credit regime for large companies only, and until then companies can elect into RDEC or continue claiming R and D tax credits as previously. The RDEC is designed to increase the visibility and certainty of UK R&D; tax relief and provide greater financial and cash flow support to companies with no corporation tax liability. Under RDEC there is no change to what is a qualifying activity or what is qualifying expenditure, but the way in which relief is given is different.

residence and domicile,"An individual s domicile and country of residence determine which of their income and gains are subject to tax in the UK. Domicile is a complex concept of general law and is based at least partially on case law. From April 2013, a statutory definition of residence has provided greater certainty for taxpayers (and the previous concept of  ordinary residence  has been abolished). An individual s residence and domicile position will depend on their particular circumstances, and determining residence and domicile can be complex. Broadly, individuals who are resident and domiciled in the UK will pay tax in the UK on their worldwide income and gains as they arise. Individuals who are not resident in the UK are only subject to UK tax on certain UK income and gains. Individuals who are resident in the UK but domiciled elsewhere are subject to UK tax on their UK income and UK gains as they arise. It is possible for them to elect, however, to only pay UK tax on their non-UK income and their gains when they are brought into (or remitted to) the UK (the  remittance basis ). With some exceptions, those who claim the remittance basis lose their UK personal allowances and annual exempt amount for capital gains. In addition, for those who wish to claim the benefit of the remittance basis, a  30,000 charge applies to those who have been resident in the UK for more than 7 out of the previous 9 years. There are higher charges for those who have been resident in the UK for 12 out of the previous 14 years, and 17 out of the previous 20 years. The tax charge is removed when non-domiciles remit foreign income or capital gains to the UK for the purpose of commercial investment in the UK. [1]"

residual,"Residual income/ revenue/ assets etc: the amount of money or assets left after all taxes or other necessary payments have been made. Residual income/ payments: money that someone gets because work that they did previously continues to produce income, for example money that a writer or actor gets when their work is broadcast again.[1] "
residual income,"Residual income can be used in a personal finance context to express a person's disposable income after paying all loans, bills and other necessary expenses. It is used to calculate their suitability for taking out, or increasing, loans or mortgages. The term residual income is also used when calculating the value of a company or stock. The residual income valuation model is net income less a charge (deduction) for common shareholders' opportunity cost in generating net income. It is the residual or remaining income after considering the costs of all of a company s capital.    Why is residual income used in company valuations  Analysts frequently use this valuation model because although traditional accounting includes a charge for the cost of debt capital, it does not account for the cost of equity capital (such as dividend payouts or other equity costs). A company, therefore, might be reporting positive net income, but may not be adding value for shareholders if it does not earn more than its cost of equity capital. Residual income models recognise the costs of all the capital used in generating income.   Britain's strategic chocolate dilemma Residual income valuation - CFA Institute"

resilience,"Resilience is a characterisation of the way successful managers deal with the inevitable but unforeseen interactions, difficulties and opportunities that arise during the implementation and operation of a business activity. The resilient manager is attentive to marketplace signals that may indicate developments requiring a possible change in plans and intentions. Sometimes these signals and the necessary action are strong and clear. More often, they are weak signals that require careful consideration and analysis before any action is taken. The resilient manager encourages others to share knowledge and interpretation of such signals to provide an early and clear basis for determining appropriate action, if any. The resilient manager is skilled in the assessment of the need for change and is able to improvise a solution that avoids pitfalls and/or takes advantage of emerging new opportunities. This improvisation may require rethinking prior understandings, the use of incomplete information and a willingness to trust in the difficult-to-substantiate views of others.  Resilience is the ability to adjust in response to the competitive forces that are constantly trying to erode your competitive advantage.  The manager who accepts the inevitability of change and the need for continuous reevaluation of activities and actions is more likely to successfully practice this important dimension of business acumen.

responsible careers,"People with responsible careers seek to address societal challenges such as environmental sustainability and social justice through their work-related choices, including what organisations and projects to join. They explicitly put their careers at the service of society.  Responsible careers have gained more legitimacy over the past decade, for example in the emerging fields of corporate responsibility, social investing, sustainability and social entrepreneurship.  But all roles offer opportunities for having influence. Responsible careers are guided by internal values, and are also very pragmatic. They involve continuous learning and judging how best to have impact in current complex and shifting landscapes. What is responsible, sustainable or of social benefit is not clear-cut, especially in the longer term. Therefore responsible careers require discernment and continual review. Networking is essential, for information and dialogue with people similarly committed to change.  People pursuing responsible careers define themselves primarily in terms of wider social issues and stakeholders, rather than their organisations. They seek to influence the latter well beyond their immediate job remits, and so may be internal activists.[1] Example Some people shift to work that they perceive as having more meaning in mid-career, deploying their accumulated expertise and understanding about how to influence change. Others start from high environmental or social awareness and find ways to express this from the outset.  Often, people pursuing responsible careers work across sectors.  They may help to create initiatives, such as new global reporting guidelines incorporating environmental sustainability, that are field-shaping and encourage corporate responsibility more generally. See Article: The rise in responsible careers"
responsible consumerism,"The term refers to the role that consumers play in helping society to be more sustainable. Such consumers act as concerned citizens through a variety of activities such as curbing excessive consumption, supporting socially responsible companies by purchasing their products and conversely boycotting products of companies that exhibit irresponsible behaviour. ExampleLOHAS, or the ""Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability"", is an example of a  ""responsible""consumer segment that focuses on health and fitness, the environment, personal development, sustainable living and social justice. [1]"
responsible investment,"Responsible investment is an investment strategy which seeks to generate both financial and sustainable value. It consists of a set of investment approaches that integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) and ethical issues into financial analysis and decision-making. Responsible investment goes by many names - it is variously referred to as socially responsible investing (SRI), ethical investing, sustainable investing, triple-bottom-line investing, green investing - but underlying these differing names is a common theme focused on long-term value creation. Value in this context refers not only to economic value, but to the broader values of fairness, justice, and environmental sustainability. Example FTSE4Good Index Series (launched in 2001) and Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (launched in 1999) are stock market sustainability/ CSR (corporate social responsibility) Indices to measure the performance of socially responsible companies that meet globally recognised corporate responsibility standards, and to facilitate investment in those companies. An example of a responsible investment  retail fund is Dexia Asset Management which offers more than 20 SRI products (equities and bonds). SRI products are based on several SRI approaches that address the challenges of sustainable development, namely the following:  best in class - aiming at selecting the best ESG performing companies in each sector; thematic - designed to select the best companies based on specific sustainability themes such as renewable energy, water use and waste management; norms-based - checking companies  and countries' compliance with international conventions such as Human Rights conventions, labour rights (International Labour Organization's convention) or the convention on hazardous chemicals (Rotterdam Convention); armament exclusion - exclusion of companies involved in the production and/ or sale of weapons.

responsible leadership,"Responsible leadership is about making business decisions that, next to the interests of the shareholders, also takes into account all the other stakeholders, such as workers, clients, suppliers, the environment, the community and future generations. When it comes to responsible leadership, here are examples of some questions to consider:  Are your business activities sustainable and are not polluting the surrounding environment  Do you identify systemic risks that your activities might contribute to, or do you take short term risks for quick profits that could endanger the reputation of your company  Do you care about the welfare of your workforce  Have you checked that your subcontractors do not use child labour   Example case studyTake Getulio who is a plant manager for a supplier in the automobile industry and is also a responsible leader.He develops a social dialogue in the plant, building strong relationships with workers and trade union leaders.  He promotes fair wage increases through collective bargaining, ensures the latest health and safety procedures are in place.  He set up a day care centre for the working parents and also negotiates many other items, like parental leave, health packages, continuing education and career paths for his staff.Getulio followed the recommendations of a committee, he created, to explore ways of recycling and developing renewable energy. As a consequence, solar panels were installed on the plant roof.Getulio also meets regularly with many of the local officials of the town nearby to make sure his company is considered as a good citizen in the community. He also promotes philanthropic activities. For example, he collected and contributed funds for the renovation of a school and he created an annual toy fare, where all the under-privileged children of the city get a toy for Christmas. [1] The financial crisis in 2008 resulted in deep and prolonged criticism of business schools for  mismanaging  the leadership education of their MBA students. There have been two broad criticisms. Firstly, that business school finance theorists were crucial in spawning the high-risk speculative investments such as the collateral debt obligations and securitised derivatives and products that were the primers to the financial crisis. Business schools have been accused of failing to imbue such theories, and also their finance courses, with ethics. The second criticism is that business ethics have generally not been taught as a core course for MBA and EMBA programmes and courses in business ethics have failed to engage hearts and minds sufficiently with the governance and responsibility dimensions of management. Soul-searching has continued amongst global business leaders at the World Economic Forum in 2010 and in 2011 on the need for business reformation and renewal. The phrase that is emerging to capture a more determined approach to governance and business ethics is responsible leadership. Responsible Leadership, as a business school subject area, is less about ethical theory and more about ethical practice based on case studies. The practice has a particular focus on an individual s values system and the pragmatic application of an individual s values in the real-life challenging dilemmas of business. Some business schools require their MBA students to engage in a responsible leadership course which provides them with the opportunity to experience social and environmental challenges and to utilise their skills and talents within an economic framework to  do good . Example Increasingly, business schools are developing their MBA curricula to address the societal challenges, dilemmas and questions arising in governance, sustainability and ethics courses. This movement is being promoted by an association of the world s leading business schools and companies under the Globally Responsible Leadership Initiative (GRLI) with the aim of  reframing the purpose of management education . The GRLI, together with the Association of MBAs, the UN Global Compact and the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), among other institutions, have established a steering committee to create and promote the Principles for Responsible Management Education (the PRME). The PRME was launched in 2008, inspired by internationally accepted values such as the principles of the UN Global Compact. By March 2011, 357 academic institutions have signed up to the PRME initiative. [2]"

retail distribution review,"The retail distribution review, or RDR, is the name that has been given to a new set of rules that will be enforced in the UK from the beginning of 2013. The rules are aimed at introducing more transparency and fairness in the investment industry. The most significant change is that financial advisers are no longer be permitted to earn commissions from fund companies in return for selling or recommending their investment products. Instead, investors now have to agree fees with the adviser upfront. In addition, financial advisers now have to offer either ""independent"" or ""restricted"" advice and explain the difference between the two   essentially making clear whether their recommendations are limited to certain products or product providers.   retail distribution review (RDR) effects Online investment sellers are expected to be the short-term winners as clients are expected to balk at paying overt fees and turn instead to online platforms that sell investments without advice.

retail fund,"Retail funds are approved by the regulator for sale to retail investors, i.e., non-professionals who are also not rich enough to qualify as ""high net worth individuals"". They are more carefully regulated than funds for professionals and rich people, who are deemed capable of looking after themselves to a greater extent. The yield of a fund is a function of both the price and the dividend paid. If one buys a fund when one unit costs  100 and the dividend paid in the following year is  5, then the yield is 5 per cent, but if one buys the same fund a week later, when its price has risen to  110, the yield (for the same dividend) is just 4.5 per cent.

retail price index,"The retail price index (RPI) and the consumer price index (CPI) are both measures of the price of goods and services in the UK. The UK government's stated policy is to use the consumer price index (CPI) for the indexation of benefits, tax credits and public service pensions, whereas it would use the retail price index (RPI) for the uprating of index-linked gilts and revalorisation of excise duties. The retail price index, or the RPI, shows the changes in the cost of living. It reflects the movement of prices in a range of goods and services used regularly, such as food, heating, housing, household goods, bus fares and petrol. Items considered most important to us, such as housing and food, are given a higher weighting in the overall index, while items, such as tobacco, are given a lower weighting. The RPI is inclusive of VAT, and other taxes, and as such can change as a result of changes in taxation levels. RPI includes some components that are not included in CPI such as some elements of owner-occupied housing, such as mortgage interest payments.    Example of retail price index (RPI) in use Measures of inflation are vital tools for economists, business and government. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee sets UK interest rates on the basis of a target figure for inflation set by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. This was RPIX (all items of RPI excluding mortgage interest payments) until it was switched to CPI in 2003.    Retail price index (RPI) in the news  In January 2013, the UK government decided not to change the way it calculated RPI despite a persistent formula effect which it felt was making RPI overstate inflation. It was felt proposed change would bring UK calculations more in line with international standards. But the Office of National Statistics reacted to fears that suddenly lowering RPI would not please users of the index who stated they they valued consistency. This decision hurt taxpayers, drivers and students and benefited those with private pensions still linked to the RPI and  anyone invested in the near  300bn index-linked government bond market.[1]"
retail prices,"The prices of goods sold to retail customers.  These are normally measured for economic data purposes by using a retail price index (RPI), which shows the change over time in the price of a fixed basket of goods and services that would be bought by a typical consumer.

Also see producer prices; wholesale prices."
retail sales,"Sales to members of the public, rather than to a shop or other business. [1] "
retail structured product,"Structured products are investments with a pre-set formula for calculating returns and a pre-set formula for calculating risk. The investment is  built  or  structured  so that the buyer knows exactly the underlying asset or market their investment returns are linked to and how the  upside  gains and  downside  risks will be calculated. Structured products originated in the wholesale finance area including an array of complex products including collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) where returns to holders were linked to payoffs from portfolios constructed of a variety of asset-backed securities. In contrast, retail structured products were initially devised by the private banking/ wealth management industry to offer wealthy clients full or partial capital protection on their investments with returns linked to an underlying asset. An example would be a capital protected investment with returns linked to the performance of the FTSE 100 index over, say, a five year period. The clients  capital would be guaranteed over the investment period and the payoff would be linked to the performance of the index over the five-year period. If the returns were based on an increase in the FTSE index, the payoff would relate to the increase in value of the index over the specified time frame. ExampleRetail structured products can come in many forms. The most common provides capital protection and returns based on an underlying index   this could be a standard market index like the FTSE or Dow Jones or more exotic indexes covering commodity prices. There are combinations of indexes from  hot  markets  - like Brazil, Russia, India and China - or  hot  asset classes such as oil, gold, soft commodities and so on. Some may have returns based on exchange rate bands - you get a pay off if exchange rates vary within a range, but no return if the rates move outside the band - or interbank rates. Typically the wealth management industry structures these products based on investor demand. The more exotic and complex the payoff then the more complicated the structuring as the underlying return to the investor is based on a variety of derivative investments. Higher risk structure products tend to have lower capital protection, say 70 per cent, with bigger potential returns. Investors in such products need to be aware of the fact that the more complex the payoff the more they will be paying to the seller for the structuring even though payment will be implicit and bundled in the price. If the underlying asset does not generate a return over the period of the investment then the investor has forgone returns that could have been earned by investing in a traditional capital protected investment such as a bond or bank deposit. Also,there may be substantial costs associated with cashing in the investment before it matures. On the other hand such products enable investors to have capital protection and payoffs related to a wide variety of underlying assets. [1]"

return on equity  ROE,"The ratio of net profit to shareholders' equity (also called book value, net assets or net worth), expressed as a percentage. A measure of how well a company uses shareholders' funds to generate a profit. [1] Return on equity (ROE), is a financial ratio that measures the return generated on stockholders /shareholders  equity, the book or accounting value of stockholders /shareholders  equity which reflects the accumulation over time of amounts received by the company from stock/share issues plus the profits/earnings retained by the company, i.e., not yet distributed in dividends (accounting value of shareholders  equity is also equal to a company s net assets, i.e., assets minus liabilities). The typical formula can be expressed as follows:  profit for the year (or net income after taxes) / stockholders  or shareholders  equityThis is generally calculated over a year and expressed as a percentage, so a company that generated  100 worth of profit for the year for  1000 of equity has a ROE of 10%.ROE is often said to be the ultimate ratio or  mother of all ratios  that can be obtained from a company s financial statement. A company can only create shareholder value, economic profits, if the ROE is greater than its cost of equity capital (the expected return shareholders require for investing in the company given the particular risk of the company).Historically, the average ROE has been around 10% to 12%, at least in the US and UK.  Furthermore, the ROE can be decomposed to understand the fundamental drivers of value creation in a company. This is known as the DuPont decomposition and can be calculated as: ROE   return on assets (ROA) X gearing (also called leverage)ROE   (profit for the year   assets) X (assets   shareholders  equity) Note that since return on assets (ROA) is profit margin multiplied by asset turnover, the DuPont decomposition is sometimes represented as follows: ROE   profit margin X asset turnover X gearing ROE   (profit for the year   sales) X (sales   assets) X (assets   shareholders  equity) The profit margin, asset turnover and gearing ratios can further be decomposed to complete the financial statement analysis or ratio analysis of a company.The profit margin tells us how much profit a company makes on every dollar of sales. The asset turnover indicates how efficient a company is in using its assets and reflects how many dollars of sales a company generates from every pound/dollar of assets in the company. Finally, the gearing ratio indicates how a company finances the assets it holds or more precisely the amount of assets per dollar of shareholder/stockholder equity investment in the company. Assets being financed either by shareholders (equity) or by creditors such as banks and suppliers (called liabilities or debt), a higher ratio means a firm is getting more financing from outside creditors (since assets must equal equity plus liabilities, an all equity firm has a gearing ratio of one since all assets are financed by equity).It would appear that greater gearing increases ROE, but this must be traded off against higher financing costs which reduces profit. Unfortunately, there are variations in ratio definitions, a normal part of practical financial ratio analysis. There are issues regarding the numerator, e.g., which profit number should be used: before or after taxes; adjusted or not for non-recurring or one-time items; or operating type profit numbers, e.g., earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation & amortisation (EBITDA).  As for the denominator, a balance sheet number is for a specific point in time by contrast to the numerator which is for a period, so some use beginning-of-year equity, others use end-of-year equity or some average over the year. Note: One of the challenges in giving a definition of accounting or finance terms is the differences in the terminology used. E.g., in the US and UK: shareholder/stockholder and profit for the year/net income. [2] ViewReasons to be cheerful keep hope alive for the moment"

revenue per user ARPU,"Revenue per user is a common metric used by telecoms service providers such as internet service providers or telephone companies. Telephone companies, in particular, usually talk of average revenue per user or Arpu, which measures revenue per user in a standard time period. Arpu is derived by dividing the company's total revenues with the total number of users in the given time period.   revenue per user, or ARPU in the news In October 2013, it was reported that a bitter price war in the French mobile communications market was weighing heavily on the fortunes of Orange. The company said that it expected average revenue per user (Arpu) to fall in 2014 even as more people were expected to sign up to premium 4G packages. However, it also predicted that higher priced mobile data tariffs would boost results from 2015. Also in October 2013, an FT writer compared the fortunes and outlook of Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter on the announcement of Twitter's planned IPO.

reverse innovation,"Historically, multinationals innovated in rich countries and sold those products in poor countries. Reverse innovation is doing just the opposite. It is about innovating in poor countries and bringing those products to rich countries. Thanks to the rapid development of populous countries like China and India and the slowing growth of wealthy nations, reverse innovation has become a strategic priority. ExampleIn the 1980s, GE Healthcare led the development of big, powerful, premium priced ultrasound scanners   designed for use in US hospitals. The company then looked for additional markets overseas. With a population of more than one billion, China offered huge potential.  By 1995, however, despite having had a presence in the country for over a decade, GE Healthcare remained a marginal player in China. Sales were a mere $5 million - negligible in GE terms -  and growth was slow. All this changed during the first decade of the 21st century. In 2002, GE introduced its first portable ultrasound scanner and by 2008, the portable product was offered for a price of $15,000, which was 15% of the cost of the traditional ultrasound. Today, the portable machine is the growth engine of GE s ultrasound business in China.  Rather than the bulky conventional machine, the new scanner looks like a laptop computer.  In China, some patients are not treated in hospitals, therefore the equipment has to be portable. The new scanner was also cheaper - recognising that the Chinese market required  value products . Even more important, portable ultrasounds have created new markets in the United States. They have been put into use in non-traditional applications, sometimes in entirely unexpected ways.  They are employed, for example, in U.S. hospital environments where space is limited and patients are immobile, such as emergency rooms and operating rooms.  Between 2002 and 2008, worldwide sales from portable ultrasound products skyrocketed from $4 million to around $278 million -  an average compound annual growth rate of 50 to 60 per cent. [1]"

riba,"In Islamic finance, riba is commonly translated as interest rate or excess. The prohibition of riba is the cornerstone of Islamic finance. Riba symbolises both the earning of money on money via a predetermined rate on a loan and a social injustice. Although making profit is allowed in Islam, earning money on money is not, because there is no productive and/or trade activity creating additional wealth. Riba also creates social injustice because lenders requiring interest on loans tend to profit from the weak position of borrowers. Thus, because social justice and fairness in business are the most important parts of muamalat (economic transactions), riba is prohibited by Shariah, or Islamic law. The market offers two types of non-riba products. The first is the cost-plus financing where the bank (lender in conventional finance) buys products and resells them with a certain margin to the client (borrower). Payment can be differed just like conventional credit instalments. The second option consists of profit and loss sharing when the bank builds up an SPV (special purpose vehicle) with the client with the aim of buying a product (a house for instance) and permits the client to buy out the participation of the bank in the SPV, also on differed payment.

Certain assets could perhaps be moved offshore which would lower that company's or person's tax liability. Ring fenced assets in some jurisdictions could also be subject to higher taxation, but the financial arrangement is made to protect the remainder of the business from the higher tax rate. The term is also used in a regulatory sense to describe a way of managing a corporation where certain parts of the business could be ring fenced to ensure that losses in one part did not affect another.   ring fence in the news In February 2013, UK chancellor, George Osborne, presented his Banking Reform Bill to parliament that aimed, for the first time ever, separate the retail and investment arms of British banks and erect a ring fence around the retail bank so its essential operations continue even if the whole bank fails. He promised that the legislation, if passed, would ""electrify the ring fence"" if the bank had been found to flout the rules."

The basic risk/return concept assumes a trade-off between the two - the more risk one takes, the higher the investment gains one should expect, and vice-versa. That is because most investors are risk-averse - faced with two investments that offer the same returns, they will choose the one that carries less risk.  Some investors are risk-neutral - they seek to maximise returns and do not care about the amount of risk involved; and a few could theoretically be risk-seeking - faced with two investments with the same expected returns, they will choose the riskiest. There are many different kinds of risk, relating not only to financial investments but also to operational concerns and the impact on earnings. These include exchange risk, political risk, regulatory risk, systematic risk (involving a whole market), non-systematic risk (involving a specific stock), etc."

risk assessment,"Risk assessments involve an examination of possible outcomes from performing an action or from making an investment so that informed choices can be made on what course of action should be taken. Risk assessments can be qualitative or quantitative. A qualitative risk assessment would generate a description of the possible outcomes. A quantitative risk assessment generates a numerical value where potential loss and probability of occurrence are calculated. Quantitative risk measures are included in investment funds data and expressed as a Sharpe ratio. The Sharpe ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate from the rate of return for a portfolio and dividing the answer you achieve by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns, (a measure of risk that looks at the diversion of actual returns from expected returns).   risk assessment in the news Qualitative discussions of risk frequently appear in news stories and often refer to investment risks. In March 2014 discussion returned to the default risk on sovereign debt. Jerome Booth, an investment manager with Ashmore, an emerging market specialist, argues in the video below that investment in emerging markets is far less risky than in their developed counterparts. "
risk assets,"Risk asset is a term broadly used to describe any financial security or instrument that is not a risk-free asset   that is, a high quality government bond. Risk assets would therefore include equities, commodities, property and all areas of fixed income apart from high quality sovereign bonds, such as gilts or Treasuries.   risk assets in the news At the beginning of 2013 analysts were wondering if the rally in risk assets would continue. The appetite for risk at the expense of Treasuries, for example, had propelled the S&P; 500 in 2012 to its highest level since 2007."

risk exposure,The amount of risk an investor has taken on in a particular investment or a portfolio. Or to what extent a business could be affected by certain factors that may have a negative impact on earnings.
risk management,"Risk management is the process of identifying, quantifying, and managing the risks that an organisation faces. As the outcomes of business activities are uncertain, they are said to have some element of risk.  These risks include strategic failures, operational failures, financial failures, market disruptions, environmental disasters, and regulatory violations. Risk is a statistical concept that is measured using statistical concepts that are related to the unknown future. Almost all investments are exposed to it.  Risk management involves identifying the types of risk exposure within the company, measuring those potential risks, proposing means to hedge, insure or mitigate some of the risks and estimatin the impact of various risks on the future earnings of the company. While it is impossible that companies remove all risk from the organisation, it is important that they properly understand and manage the risks that they are willing to accept in the context of the overall corporate strategy.  The management of the company is primarily responsible for risk management, but the board of directors, internal auditor, external auditor, and general counsel also play critical roles. Risk can be managed in a number of ways: by the buying of insurance, by using derivative instruments as hedges, by sharing risks with others, or by avoiding risky positions altogether. risk management example As factories can be dangerous places to work, it is important that companies implement appropriate risk management processes.  For example, a company can reduce the likelihood of an accident by limiting work schedules (to reduce employee fatigue), locating equipment in areas that are less vulnerable to damage, performing regular maintenance on equipment, performing regular environmental reviews and establishing communication protocols between line workers, supervisors and management.

risk neutral,
"risk on, risk off","Risk-on, risk-off (RoRo) investing describes a process where investors move to riskier potentially higher yielding investments and then back again to supposedly lower yielding investments which are perceived to have lower risk. Quite often risk-on, risk-off behaviour follows global markets, where periods of perceived low financial risk encourage investors to take risk, therefore creating a risk-on situation, and periods of perceived high financial risk cause investors to take less risk, creating a risk-off situation. [1] The switching between high risk and low risk investments began to happen more frequently and in greater volumes in the fallout to the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Roro (risk on, risk off) can cause investors to behave in a herd-like manner depending on the risk environment.  This investor behaviour is more likely to occur in times of economic uncertainty. [2]   risk on, risk off in the news At the beginning of 2013 analysts speculated that the era of Risk On, Risk Off might be coming to an end because there were signs that the US Federal Reserve might be leaning towards ending quantitative easing at some point during 2013. Quantitative easing, or QE, by the US and the UK has artificially depressed yields on traditional safe haven investments such as Treasuries and gilts squeezing investors into riskier investment forays.

risk parity,"A term used to describe the practice of trying to spread risk equally among several different asset classes. Because certain asset classes, such as stocks, tend to be more volatile, the weighting of assets is not equal. [1]"
risk premium,The additional return an investor expects from holding a risky asset rather than a riskless one - in essence the difference between the total expected return on an investment and the appropriate estimated risk-free return.
risk profile,The degree of probability that a company will make payments on its debt. [1] 
risk shifting,"Risk shifting, which is also known as asset substitution, occurs if managers make overly risky investment decisions that maximise shareholder value at the expense of debtholders  interests. A stockholder's claim on a levered company can be viewed as a call option on the group's asset value. Since equity downside risk is limited, managers of levered firms have incentives to increase the riskiness of the firm's business - so they substitute safe assets with risky assets, to raise the upside potential of this option. The incentive to shift risk increases with a company's leverage. At the extreme, even projects with negative present value may be chosen simply because of their high risk. Example Highly levered companies often bear extremely high costs of debt financing because debt investors ask for a premium to outweigh the negative consequences of risk-shifting incentives. [1]"
risk tolerance,The extent to which an investor is prepared to accept an increase in risk for the same expected returns.

risk-free asset,"Risk-free assets are those whose rate of return is seen as certain and are generally defined as high quality government bonds. However, as the eurozone sovereign debt crisis progressed in 2012 analysts and investors increasingly questioned not only whether weaker eurozone sovereign credits were risk free; they extended their concerns to US Treasuries and UK gilts. Risk-free assets are defined by the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' bank based in Basel, which assesses the risk weightings of all classes of assets that might be held by a bank. It uses the term risk free to describe assets associated with a sufficiently high probability of creditors being repaid to allow credit risk not to be explicitly taken into account in investment decisions by market participants.   Risk-free assets in the news At the end of 2012, while there was a widespread perception that the pool of safe assets was shrinking, public sector debt  in the developed world , including the supply so-called risk-free Treasuries and gilts, was soaring. Many economists argued there was no such thing as a risk-free asset. However others argued that the ongoing demand for Treasuries whenever there is a risk-off period shows most investors still regard them as the ultimate haven asset. Similar definitions of risk-free assets are used by pension funds who must satisfy national regulators that they hold sufficient assets to cover future liabilities. They use the risk-free rate, generally defined as the yield on high-quality government bonds, to calculate their ability to cover future liabilities."
risk-free rate,"The risk-free rate, or as it is sometimes known, the risk-free interest rate, is the yield on high quality government bonds. For most investors the US Treasury yield is the risk-free benchmark against which other assets can be measured. Pension funds use the the risk-free rate to  to discount their liabilities to present value, so they can compare them with assets and get a funding ratio. They use it for their own internal purposes. They use a different rate to discount liabilities for the purposes of the deficit companies have to report on their balance sheets.  Risk-free rate in the news The unprecedented downgrade of US debt by the ratings agency Standard & Poor's in 2011   although in practice it had virtually nil impact on the issue of Treasuries   sparked serious discussion on whether it was appropriate to use continue to use US Treasury yields to determine the risk-free rate. Meanwhile, in 2012 attention was turning to pension funds. The main concern centred around the rise in liabilities due to falling yields on high quality bonds, which raised the deficits of pension funds and required employers to put in more money. There has been pressure in the UK to let funds smooth the discount rate and in the US and other countries they have moved to do this, to take the pressure off employers."
risk-free return,"The return on a risk-free asset, which is added to a risk premium when calculating the total expected return on an investment.  The risk-free return in such calculations is normally the yield on short-term government paper, which is considered virtually risk-free."
risk-seeking,See risk
risk-weighted assets,"Global banking supervisors based in Basel Switzerland use the concept of risk-weighted assets to determine a bank s minimum capital needs. Risk-weighted assets are computed by adjusting each asset class for risk in order to determine a bank's real world exposure to potential losses. Regulators then use the risk weighted total to calculate how much loss-absorbing capital a bank needs to sustain it through difficult markets. Under the Basel III rules, banks must have top quality capital equivalent to at least 7 per cent of their risk-weighted assets or they could face restrictions on their ability to pay bonuses and dividends. The risk weighting varies accord to each asset's inherent potential for default and what the likely losses would be in case of default - so a loan secured by property is less risky and given a lower multiplier than one that is unsecured. Under the Basel II banking accord, which still governs most risk-weighting decisions, government bonds with ratings above AA- have a weight of 0 per cent, corporate loans rated above AA- are weighted 20 per cent, etc. The rules also attempt to classify assets by their credit risk, operational risk and market risk.

roll yield,"This describes the cost of shifting between two futures contracts, usually with reference to commodity futures. An investor who has bought a front-month oil future might wish to keep his position open (active) even though the front-month contract is due to expire. So the investor can sell the expiring front-month futures contract and buy the next maturing futures contract and this process is known as ""rolling a position"". If the futures curve is in backwardation, that is downward sloping so that the front-month contract is more expensive than the next maturing contract, then the investor will earn a positive roll yield. However, if the futures curve is in contango, that is upward sloping so that the the front-month contract is less expensive than the next maturing contract, then the investor will incur a negative roll yield.

The definition of safe assets contains a strong regulatory component because regulators often define what safe assets are   for example, when it comes to assessing bank balance sheets under the terms of Basel III.   safe assets in the news High quality assets are used as collateral but at the beginning of 2013 there were concerns that there was a shortage of such assets causing a collateral crunch. There were still plenty of high-quality government bonds around, but legitimate concerns remained over, for example, the eurozone, where perceptions about the safety of sovereign debt had been undermined. Central bankers and regulators meeting in Basel in January 2013 included a formal definition of high-quality liquid assets for the purpose of global liquidity standards. While government bonds, cash and central bank reserves remain the gold standard for safe assets, the Basel Committee said that covered bonds, investment-grade corporate bonds, high-quality mortgage-backed securities and some equities could also qualify.[1] View Desperately seeking a line in safe assets"

safe harbour,"This is an agreement between the US and the European Commission that lets businesses transfer data on European citizens across the Atlantic. The EU s rules on data protection make it illegal to transfer personal details to any country that does not meet the bloc s privacy standards. Safe harbour, which was set up in 2000, provides a shortcut for companies operating in the US. If they agree to meet certain rules   such as notifying customers when their information is collected and used   they can then transfer data from the EU to the US. [1] The term also refers to a provision in a law or regulation that protects companies or individuals acting in good faith from liability in certain situations. A company making an earnings forecast could be protected in this way.   safe harbour in the news The agreement was ruled invalid by the European Court of Justice in a judgment released in 2015. The safe harbour is based on the assumption that US data privacy rules provide equivalent protections to consumers as those in the EU. But it has come under intense scrutiny since Edward Snowden leaked internal NSA memos that raised questions as to the effectiveness of the US rules. [2]"

The study found one in 10 US adults in their 40s and 50s with a parent aged 65 or older are providing primary carer for a parent. How best to provide and pay for care for the elderly has become an important issue for governments worldwide. Many countries are grappling with how to shift care out of hospitals and into the home. sandwich generation in the news In January 2014, an FT reporter wrote that the Royal Bank of Scotland offered eldercare or an elderly care service as one of the company's employee benefits. For example, this allowed one staff member to book someone through the service to accompany his mother to hospital and back. KPMG, the professional services group, also noticed that many of its employees were balancing their day jobs with taking care of relatives, so it began offering eldercare services in 2013. In October 2013, an FT writer reported that in China, many filial rental services have sprung up on the Chinese equivalent of eBay called Taobao since a new law came into force in that year, which makes it a legal requirement to visit or phone elderly relatives. For example, a woman called Yang Ying advertises her services on Taobao as a type of surrogate grown child.

scepticism identification model,"A scepticism identification model (SIM) is a framework that helps managers assess the effectiveness of consumer-generated advertising. Recent research finds that user-generated content (UGC) can trigger two opposing reactions from other consumers   scepticism and identification. While there is an increase in identification of the viewer with the ad creator, there could also be an increase in scepticism about the expertise or ability of the ad creator to generate appropriate content (i.e. persuasive advertisements). Factors that diminish scepticism include low-involvement and high distraction contexts, whereas factors that enhance identification involve increasing perceived similarity and a sense of affiliation or social connectedness between the viewer and content developer. These principles of SIM are applicable to other types of user-generated content as well.[1]   scepticism identification model in the news In January 2013 the Open Forum, an online magazine, ran an article commenting on the success of user generated content, for example, by uploading pictures of themselves wearing the clothes the company wishes to advertise, in marketing for Burberry and other big name brands.

secular stagnation,"Secular stagnation is a condition of negligible or no economic growth in a market-based economy. When per capita income stays at relatively high levels,  the percentage of savings is likely to start exceeding the percentage of longer-term investments in, for example, infrastructure and education, that are necessary to sustain future economic growth. The absence of such investments (and consequently of the economic growth) leads to declining levels of per capita income (and consequently of per capita savings). With the reduced percentage savings rate converging with the reduced investment rate, economic growth comes to a standstill   ie, it stagnates. In a free economy, consumers anticipating secular stagnation, might transfer their savings to more attractive-looking foreign countries. This would lead to a devaluation of their domestic currency, which would potentially boost their exports, assuming that the country did have goods or services that could be exported. Persistent low growth, especially in Europe, has been attributed by some to secular stagnation initiated by stronger European economies, such as Germany, in the past few years.[1]"

securities lending,"Securities lending, which can involve the lending of bonds as well as stock lending, involves the transfer of securities from one party to another   such as from a mutual fund or institutional investor to a hedge fund. The borrower gives collateral in the form of shares, bonds or cash and also pays the lender a fee each month for the loan (it would be more accurate to think of securities lending as securities renting). The borrower is also contractually obliged to return the securities on demand within the standard market settlement period, which would be three days for UK equities. Securities lending generates revenue for the lenders, who might otherwise see little return from long-term holding of low-yielding stock. It also provides liquidity in the market. Securities lenders retain their right to any stock dividends that are paid to them by the borrower, but lose their right to vote the shares while they are lent out. This means in order to vote, they need to recall the shares. There are broad risks in securities lending. One is borrower risk   the borrower might default on the loan, for example, if the borrower becomes insolvent. The other risk is collateral risk. This is the risk that the value of the collateral falls below the replacement cost of the securities that are lent.   securities lending in the news In May 2013 The Economist reported on how the practice of securities lending could be vulnerable to the proposed financial transaction tax in eurozone countries: ""For now, the future of securities lending looks uncertain rather than outright gloomy. The danger is that it will be stymied just when it will be needed to fuel derivatives trade. Regulators in both America and Europe now want all derivatives contracts to change in ways that will require much higher levels of collateral and thus securities lending. Should such financial activity indeed be severely limited, nobody will much miss the tax-dodging holiday of European shares in springtime. Other benefits would be harder to replace."" Also in May 2013 a post on FT Alphaville warned that the financial transaction tax could extinguish the repo and securities lending markets. "

Likewise, it should possess sufficiently strong mechanisms which protect it from threats as they present themselves.[1]   an example of a security policy from history During the Middle Ages, the Republic of Venice established a system of protection for its principal industrial property: the fabrication of Venetian glass.

seed enterprise investment scheme,"An enhanced form of the enterprise investment scheme (EIS), the seed enterprise investment scheme (SEIS) provides more generous tax reliefs than EIS. It focuses on smaller early stage companies carrying on or preparing to carry on, a new business in qualifying trade. Broadly, there is a 50 percent income tax relief for individuals who invest in shares of qualifying companies where their interest is 30 percent or less. In addition, individuals can obtain a capital gains tax exemption where qualifying conditions are satisfied. A further incentive exists for those investors as chargeable gains can be rolled over. An annual investment limit of  100,000 is set for individuals and a cumulative investment limit of  150,000 for companies applies. Further, the company must not have assets in excess of  200,000 before the investment and should have 25 or fewer employees. It is important to note that the company must neither be a subsidiary or have subsidiaries. [1]"

seigniorage,"The profit made by a government from the printing of money, literally the face value of the money minus the cost of physically making it. [1] Seigniorage is the revenue governments derive because the cost of minting coins or printing paper money is less than the market value of the money. [2] The basic idea of seigniorage is that whenever the cost of producing the money used in circulation is more than the intrinsic value of the money the government loses money on seigniorage, while if the market value is higher than the cost of producing the money the government makes money on seigniorage. Essentially, it is the value the government generates by adding its stamp to an ordinary piece of paper, piece of metal or nowadays an electronic bank entry. Paper/ electronic fiat money generally has high seigniorage because you do not have to source physical metal to create it, while coins have lower seigniorage because it costs something to create the coins and source the metal. [3] Today, seigniorage is associated with central banks and issuance of notes. ExampleIn 1290, King Philip IV of France did not have enough money to pay for his wars, so he began to debase the currency by increasing the seigniorage he extracted from melting new coins. This policy produced a devaluation of the French currency, inflation and the disappearance of gold and silver from the kingdom. This is exactly the same as printing money, an increased monetary base with less intrinsic value creates inflation, as defined by Irving Fisher s theory. As the level of goods available for sale are exactly the same, more money in circulation results in higher inflation as these goods will be sold at higher prices to compensate. To secure cash the King had to arrest the Lombards (1292), then the Jews (1306) and finally the Templar Knights (1307), and confiscated their assets to issue new coins. [4]"

selective outsourcing,"Selective outsourcing involves outsourcing only part of an activity and performing the rest of the activity in-house. Selective outsourcing is generally more successful than total outsourcing for two main reasons.  First, companies that outsource an entire activity tend to be constrained in their ability to control the supplier. This means that companies that outsource an entire activity no longer have a sufficient level of expertise in-house to control or manage their supplier. Second, when companies perform a part of the activity in-house, they have access to the operational knowledge and information required to design effective reporting systems. Hence, it is far more difficult for the supplier to behave opportunistically.   The problem with total outsourcing, for instance, is suppliers may charge excess fees for services that are not included in the contract. They may also make promises knowing well that they will break these in an instant, should the benefits from breaking these promises exceed the costs or disadvantages. ExampleSelective outsourcing tends to be successful on activities that are heterogeneous and a company's logistics operations are typically heterogeneous. Logistics focuses on the organisation of the flow of resources and information across the supply chain to meet the needs of customers. Examples of selective outsourcing work could include warehousing and transportation. J r me Barth lemy, professor of management, Essec Business School"

self-employed,"Having your own business, rather than being employed by a company. The self-employed: people who work for themselves, rather than being employed by a company.[1] "
self-employment,"Self-employment is the simplest form of business organisation, comprising in its most basic form a one-person firm without an employer or employees. Generally, self-employment is both a distinct legal construct and a separate employment category under tax law. Thus, self-employed people have to declare their incomes to the tax authorities themselves and are required to file their taxes on separate tax forms from employees.Unlike employees, they are eligible for business related deductions and in many jurisdictions face different tax rates and social security eligibility requirements.In law, the self-employed are governed by the notion of a contract for services rather than a contract of service.  A contract for services means that self-employed are subject to the law of contracts regarding delivery of agreed services to clients, for example, a carpenter agrees to make a table for a client within an agreed time to an agreed standard and at an agreed price.  A contract of service applies to employees who are subject to the law of contracts to deliver an agreed amount of service to an employer, for example, a shop assistant agrees to work 35 hours per week at particular times to discharge an agreed range of duties in the shop.This notion helps tax authorities determine when workers are  genuinely  self-employed or are artificially labelled, as a result, by employers wishing to minimize their tax liabilities.Some self-employed people employ others, either in unincorporated sole proprietorships or partnerships. Once a self-employee incorporates their business, they technically become employees of their corporation; they are taxed accordingly. Self-employment is frequently regarded as a form of entrepreneurship. All entrepreneurs are self-employed, although perhaps not all self-employed are entrepreneurs.ExampleAbout one-tenth of the workforce in most western economies is self-employed. About twice as many men than women are self-employed.  On average, the self-employed are older than employees, retire later, and save and accumulate more wealth over their lifetimes.Evidence from a diverse array of countries reveals that the self-employed express greater satisfaction with their jobs and lives than employees do.  Also, they also appear to be more optimistic than the general population.They are also about twice as likely to have self-employed parents as employees are, suggesting a strong intergenerational component to self-employment.

As you'll be controlling your own retirement nest egg, you need to be a reasonably experienced investor to take out a sipp. [1] ViewSipps vs personal pensionsWeird and wacky Sipp investments"

sell in May and go away principle,"This refers to the historical underperformance of stocks in May to October in relation to the November to April period. The May to October weakness does not necessarily occur every year. Likewise stock markets do not always experience strength from November to April.ExampleHistorical evidence has shown that the May to October period represents a relatively weak semi-annual period for the stock market on average (but not every year), while the November to April period is a relatively strong semi-annual period for the stock market. If an investor had followed the Wall Street axiom of  sell in May and go away  consistently, patiently and with discipline in the long run, s/he would have profited handsomely over the last 50 years.

sense-making,"A process of understanding and explicitly connecting the impact of current decisions and actions on future outcomes in order to select a best course of action. Often, business situations are highly complex and there may be little guidance to be gleaned from past experience. Usually managers are faced with situations that present a choice from among several options.  The decision process calls for an analysis of each these options to determine which, if any, best achieves the goals of the organisation.  The process requires an understanding of the options, an assessment of the range of outcomes that might be expected under each option and an ability to compare and select when, as is often the case, multiple objectives are to be accomplished. Because sense-making deals with the unknowable future, it will be necessary to develop and use expectations (assumptions) about the future business environment, legislative initiatives, technical advances and a host of other factors that affect the success of business initiatives. These expectations must be grounded in logic, shared with and explained to others, and be subject to revision as appropriate.   Examples Hiring decisions must make sense in light of the future responsibilities and potential accomplishments of the new hire.  Product decisions require making sense of how future customer buying decisions will affect product success.  Capacity expansion choices need a sense of future growth possibilities to help decide the nature of today s investment.

sentiment analysis,"A linguistic analysis technique where a body of text is examined to characterise the tonality of the document.  Though the method pre-dates modern technological tools, the use of sentiment analysis has accelerated in recent years with the development of large-scale computational infrastructure that can analyse large unstructured textual data sets.Given the growth of user-generated content, sentiment analysis is useful in social media monitoring to automatically characterise the overall feeling or mood of consumers as reflected in social media toward a specific brand or company. Thomson Reuters uses sentiment analysis in a number of its different products to provide traders with information about how companies are faring in news articles. [1] ExampleBy monitoring trends on sites such as Twitter, as well as comments on popular blogs, companies are using software to carry out 'sentiment analysis' around their brands. This, for example, can give managers an early warning of a customer service issue, or even that a competitor has come to market with a more attractive offering.These tactical insights are valuable to businesses, because they can often provide quicker feedback than conventional data sources, such as customer service records or point of sale systems. By the time a business notices a fall-off in sales from its back office systems, the customer has already moved on. [2]"

sequestration,"Sequestration is a term used to describe a programme of automatic spending cuts in the US aimed at reducing its deficit by $1.2tn.   sequestration in the news Sequestration came into effect on March 1 2013, after Congress failed to reach agreement over a more targeted deficit reduction strategy. The $85bn in planned cuts were part of a nine-year plan that aimed to see each area of the US discretionary budget cut equally. Military personnel were to be exempt from the automatic cuts but as many as 800,000 civilian Pentagon staff would have pay cuts or be put on temporary unpaid leave. The Federal Aviation Authority would have to temporarily lay off 10 per cent of its workforce as would the Center for Disease Control. There would be no prioritisation. In February 2013, Roger Altman, former US deputy treasury secretary, writing for the FT said that when the legislation that established the sequestration was passed in 2011, its impact was seen as so blunt that no one would accept it. The idea was to force Congress into a more reasonable approach to deficit reduction. But he observed that Democrats and Republicans were still miles apart on finding a substitute. President Barack Obama condemned the impending cuts as a ""meat cleaver"" approach to deficit reduction. Meanwhile, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, co-chairs of the president's 2010 bipartisan debt commission, presented a revised plan to avert sequestration. In April 2013, sequestration was being blamed for trapping the US in a pattern of steady but mediocre growth, despite a pick up in the housing market. Congress was meanwhile taking a first step to roll back sequestration with a vote aimed at stopping temporary lay-offs of air traffic controllers which have led to flight delays across the US. In May 2013, an improvement in the US budget deficit was thought to be partly due to the automatic spending cuts known as sequestration. In September 2013 the FT launched a series that examined the effects of sequestration. The first looked at Fort Campbell which has seen over 3,000 employees forced to take furloughs, creating a ripple of shutdowns across the base. "

[1]"
serious games,"Serious games are games designed for a purpose beyond pure entertainment. They use the motivation levers of game design   such as competition, curiosity, collaboration, individual challenge   and game media, including board games through physical representation or video games, through avatars and 3D immersion, to enhance the motivation of participants to engage in complex or boring tasks. Serious games are therefore used in a variety of professional situations such as education, training, assessment, recruitment, knowledge management, innovation and scientific research. The increased involvement of participants offers new stimulating possibilities: for example the players of the virtual puzzle game Foldit contribute to scientific research on different diseases (HIV, Aids etc.) through protein folding.   The use of serious games strategies in business schools In the complex and often slow-moving education sector, serious games challenge not only learners and teachers but also an organisation's strategy. How can business schools use serious games in order to create a competitive advantage  Firstly the school tend to start with a recycling strategy in which teachers integrate free-to-use serious games in their lectures. But this approach relies on an individual, often a  geek , professor to use his own expertise to translate what happens in the game in a pedagogical context. This is difficult to communicate and to replicate in other lectures and also leaves the business school exposed to the risk of the professor leaving.  The second approach sees the business school invest in buying the licences of some serious games, but soon professors tire of this approach also and begin to find fault with the games. At the third stage an institution sees the value of a serious games authoring tool and start making their own games. Motivated teachers develop stimulating simulation for their own lecture, and even sell them to other organisations. But after a while, most teachers realise that, even if it is fun, it is not their job to develop games and that they prefer to focus on their area of expertise. In the next stage an organisation decides to help teachers by getting external professional games editors to make bespoke products. However, this is expensive and the high level of investment reduces the number of games that can be produced that way. In the fifth stage the business school decides launch a suite of serious games. As the level of investment is not affordable, they develop a co-branding strategy with an external games editor in order to co-develop and co-brand a collection of serious games on specific topics. The editor and the school share costs, expertise and copyrights. The collection can then be sold in serious games stores as generic games. [1]"

service innovation,"Service innovation takes place in different forms using different factor inputs such as IT hardware, knowledge, and investment in staff training, marketing and research and development (R&D;). Service innovation does not necessarily take place in formalised R&D; laboratories or research centres. Service innovations are difficult to protect and can be easily imitated. This is the case with several knowledge-intensive business services such as boutique business consultancies offering creative tailored solutions to their customers. Financial institutions invest large amounts in financial innovation and information and communications technologies that do not count as R&D; or innovation in the UK.  Service innovation in this case refers to the innovation and improvement of processes and delivery of financial services. Several leading financial services firms have now realised the need for talent in service innovation, and are investing heavily in senior managers from outside the industry (most notably, from manufacturing enterprises) to drive the alignment of technology, human resource management, and strategy.   In retail establishments, such as fashion boutique houses or convenience stores, service performance and productivity can be heightened through innovative use of the sales area, or improved service delivery, and strategic choice of locations. As services contribute a huge percentage of GDP in developed economies such as the UK, US and Singapore, service innovation is important to the competitiveness of such economies.[1] *Service Measurement and Definition: Challenges and limitations Battisti, G., Dwivedi, Y.

Your use of these services is an example of service consumption at the individual, or business-to-consumer (B2C), level. Organisations also use a wide array of business-to-business (B2B) services, varying to some degree according to the nature of their industry, but usually involving purchases of a much larger scale than those made by individuals or families. Nowadays, firms are outsourcing more and more tasks to external service providers in order to focus on their core business. What are services  The formal definition is services are an economic activity offered by one party to another, most commonly employing time-based performances to bring about desired results in recipients themselves or in objects or other assets for which purchasers have responsibility.  Time-based means something the firm does, which is within a certain time period.  Desired results are outcomes desired by the customer.  For example, you go to a theatre to be entertained and to a university to get an education.  These are the desired results. In exchange for their money, time and effort, service customers expect to obtain value from access to goods, labour, professional skills, facilities, networks and systems.  However, they do not normally take ownership of any of the physical elements involved (Lovelock and Wirtz 2011). What is so special about services marketing   Services marketing focuses on the distinctive characteristics of services and how they affect both customer behaviour and marketing strategy.  For example, many services are produced and delivered with the customer present at the service firm s facility. The presence of the customer in the service facility means that capacity management becomes an important driver of the firm s profitability. For example, if too few customers are present, the high fixed costs of operating and staffing the facility cannot be covered, and if too many customers show up, their service experience often deteriorates and customers who have to be turned away may not want to come back. To address this constant struggle of having the right number of customers show up, pricing of services tends to be highly dynamic and complicated   think of the pricing of airline tickets and all the terms and conditions attached to a discounted ticket. Prices change all the time, and typically dependent on when you travel, how long in advance you make your booking, how long you stay at the destination, whether the ticket is flexible and allows for changes in travel dates and itinerary, and whether it is refundable. Such pricing is also called revenue management or yield management. In services marketing, the traditional 4Ps of the marketing mix (product, pricing, promotion/market communications, place/distribution) are adapted to the distinctive features of services.  Then, there are the 3 additional Ps of services marketing: people, physical evidence and process. The process of service delivery is often as important as the function of the service.  A service is a process from the organisation s point of view, but an experience from the customers perspective. The quality of the experience is a function of the careful design of customer service processes, adoption of standardised procedures, rigorous management of service quality, high standards of training and automation. Services marketing helps to ensure that these processes are designed from the customer s perspective. Physical environment includes the appearance of buildings, landscaping, interior furnishing, equipment, uniforms, signs, printed materials and other visible cues that provide evidence of service quality and guide customers through the service process. The design on the physical environment can have a profound impact on customer satisfaction and service productivity. People refer to the frontline employees of the firm. From a customer s point of view, when service employees are involved, the people are the service. This means that frontline employees need to possess the required technical and interpersonal skills and a positive attitude.  People can be a key competitive advantage for many service firms. Services marketing includes building customer loyalty, managing relationships, complaint handling, improving service quality and productivity of service operations, and how to become a service leader in your industry. Example Imagine you want to open a new restaurant.  Services marketing would then guide you on how to develop the 7Ps including the:  Core product: What is your value proposition  What sort of dining experience you wish to deliver, for example, one that is ideal for romantic fine-dining or business lunches  Pricing: What price levels and menu designs you want to offer such as lower priced off-peak menu  Promotion/market communications: How to reach your target audience and shape their visitation behaviour  Place: Where do you locate your restaurant  People: How do you select, train, motivate and retain your front-line employees  Physical evidence: What will the interior of the restaurant look like  Process: How do you design service processes to satisfy customers  This can range from seating to preparing the bill   Services marketing would also help guide your thinking about how to develop long-term profitable relationships with your customers, design complaint handling and service recovery processes and policies, help you to systematically improve the quality of your service and the productivity of the entire operations.

shadow banking,"The system of non-deposit taking financial intermediaries including investment banks, hedge funds, monoline insurance firms and other securities operators. These non traditional entities grew up complementing the traditional banking system during the property boom between 2001 and 2008, particularly in the US. All operated in different parts of the securitisation business where mortgage loans were packaged as securities, moved off bank balance sheets and distributed, via various investment vehicles, to an array of investors. The securitisation activity fuelled the residential mortgage lending boom that in turn boosted property prices up to mid-2007 until the onset of the sub-prime crisis and the subsequent banking crisis. [1]   shadow banking in the news In July 2013 it was reported that China's shadow banking system had become both a concern and an opportunity for investors. The FT reported that the booming sector had recently been  estimated by a Chinese banking regulator to amount to Rmb8.2tn ($1.3tn). But many analysts were saying the figure was much higher, with Deutsche Bank estimating that shadow banking accounts for 40 per cent of gross domestic product   or Rmb21tn. Large amounts of money had entered the system via the sale of wealth management products and was being used to invest in real estate and local government infrastructure projects but offered investors no guarantees. Given the lack of disclosure, transparency and meaningful collateral, hedge funds have begun shorting the shares of banks offering these wealth management products.   "

shakeout,"When over-supply in an industry forces smaller competitors to merge with or be acquired by larger players, or to exit the sector altogether. [1] A shakeout is a fast drop in the number of independent producers in a given industry. Most shakeouts are accompanied by growth in industry output and average firm size, and are preceded by a fast rise in the number of producers. According to Jovanovic and MacDonald (1994), the reason for these changes is a technological innovation that dramatically increases the efficient scale of production. ExampleOne of the most notable shakeouts happened in the US automobile tyre industry before the Great Depression. Between 1922 and 1929, the number of independent producers dropped from 278 to 122, in spite of a fast growth in industry output. According to Jovanovic and MacDonald (1994), what caused this shakeout was the invention of the Banbury mixer in 1916. This equipment, which is used for mixing rubber and plastic, increased the efficient scale of production.  The US beer brewing industry experienced a similar phenomenon a few decades earlier. The number of producers dropped by 40% between 1880 and 1890. But perhaps the most famous shakeout was the one that characterised the US automobile industry in the early 20th century. The number of car manufacturers dropped from 274 in 1909 to 121 in 1918. [2] ReferencesJovanovic, B. and MacDonald G.

shale gas,"Shale gas is natural gas trapped within shale rock formations underground. Advances in hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking""   the process of forcing fluids at high pressure into wellbores to fracture the shale rock, allowing the gas to escape   encouraged an investment boom in north America. That led to a big increase in production which brought US gas prices to a 10 year low in April 2012. The price of gas in North America remains far lower than in Europe or Asia.  FT explains more on shale gas US success in securing home-grown energy has attracted interest globally, with many other countries now seeking to exploit their own shale gas reserves. Environmental activists have opposed the growth in shale gas, arguing that techniques like fracking can contaminate water resources and damage the environment. Some have questioned the viability of shale gas, arguing that gas flows from such operations decline more quickly than from conventional gas wells, making the investment unprofitable in the long term. Unlike traditional reservoirs, shale is a low-porosity rock from which oil and gas will not flow freely without additional stimulation from hydraulic fracturing or fracking.[1] Shale gas production was pioneered in the early 2000s by US independent companies such as Devon Energy and Chesapeake Energy.

short sale,"A trading strategy aimed at taking advantage of an expected fall in prices. An investor, normally via a broker, sells shares that are not actually held but have been borrowed from another investor or broker. This process is called short selling, selling short or shorting.

short-termism,"Short-termism refers to an excessive focus on short-term results at the expense of long-term interests.  A report from the Business Roundtable Institute for Corporate Ethics and the CFA Institute - Breaking the Short-term Cycle - notes that an excessive short-term focus by some corporate leaders, investors, and analysts combined with insufficient regard for long-term strategy can tip the balance in value-destructive ways for market participants, undermine the market s credibility, and discourage long-term value creation and investment.  Some analysis of the global economic downturn points to short-termism of financial institutions and lenders as a root cause. ExampleSuch short-term strategies are often based on accounting-driven metrics and profit maximisation that fail to fully reflect not only the complexities of corporate management and investment, but also the significant opportunities and risks associated with these strategies. The most prevalent accounting-driven metric is the earnings per share (EPS). Research by scholars John Graham, Campbell Harvey and Shivaram Rajgopal has shown that managers are making real decisions - such as decreasing spending on research and development, maintenance and hiring of critical employees - in order to hit quarterly earnings targets they have provided as part of their own guidance.

silver fix,"London's silver price fix was on its deathbed in first half of 2014 after 117 years of operation when one of the three market makers, Deutsche Bank, announced its intention to resign its seat leaving just HSBC and Bank of Nova Scotia on the silver fix. Deutsche Bank set its resignation date as the 14 of August at which point, it said, the benchmark would terminate. Until that date, the price would continue to be fixed once a day at 12 noon in London via a telephone conference. The fixing follows the same process as the gold fixing. Members take the prevailing US dollar spot price as the opening price for London silver. The membersthen declare buying and selling interest at that price. The price is then fixed to balance demand and supply.   Silver fix in the news In May 2014 the FT reported that regulatory attention had removed lustre from the once prestigious precious metals fixes. Claims of abuse by bankers in the silver futures markets led to a five year probe by the US Commodity and Futures Trading Commission which found no evidence of wrongdoing in 2013. Critics say the fixing process is old fashioned and opaque. In June 2014 the London Metal Exchange offered three alternatives to the silver fix: to enhance the existing phone method, to use the Exchange's open outcry floor or to make use of its electronic platform.

slack,"Slack was defined for the first time by Cyert and March in 1963 as ""the difference between the payments required maintaining the organisation and the resources obtained from the environment by the coalition"". Generally slack can be an explicit or a tacit resource, which an organisation has acquired and which is not committed to necessary expenditure. Explicit slack includes all the resources employed with sub-optimal profitability (such as high cash reserves   commonly referred to as a  war chest , which allow a company to react quickly to new challenges) and are visible on the balance sheet. Tacit slack exists mainly for three reasons. First because of general uncertainty in planning resources; second because of situations where only sub-optimal planning is possible (for instance if growth opportunities are too few to exhaust the resources already in place for expected growth); or third because employees usually have a better understanding of their detailed resource consumption than their managers do and  obfuscate  to their managers when fixing objectives. Slack can be used, for example, in R&D; as bootleg projects, which draw heavily on the availability of overhead slack. [1] "

Australian captain Michael Clarke was heard telling England batsman Jimmy Anderson ""get ready for a broken fucking arm"".

slow management,"Stemming from the Anglo-Saxon concept  Management by Walking Around  (MBWA), and profoundly rooted in the endeavours of HP founders, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, slow management's ambition is to restore men and women to the heart of organisations. Slow management, a trait of great leaders, holds in three key notions. Firstly, Men and women in businesses require, above anything else, meaning and recognition. This can only be conveyed through one-to-one meetings and gatherings   in other words, the time that managers physically give their employees. Secondly, practicing slow management doesn t mean going slowly, actually it is the opposite. It is about understanding that taking the time to meet your team is about contributing to their well-being and thus, contributing to the performance of the business as a whole. Thirdly, practising slow management forces managers to get out of their offices to meet their collaborators to become what Jack Welch recommended, a manager professor. This kind of manager is capable of grasping the key advantages offered by formal and informal gatherings to teach, convey a message, answer questions, share values, share a culture, and, at the same time, be capable of learning from those to whom he or she is talking.[1]"

slump,"A marked decline in performance (by an economy or a market, an industry, a company, etc), though relatively short-term."
slush fund,"A slush fund can be any sum of money gathered and set aside as a reserve. For example a sporting club might raise money from its members to pay for fixtures throughout the year and any money left over in the slush fund might be put towards an annual social event. In politics or in the corporate world the term slush fund is often used to describe money raised from a secret or illegitimate source and/or used for fraudulent or unpopular purposes. For example, a company might be said to be treating its pension fund as a slush fund if it raids it to repay its own debts or even to pay for assets that will not be owned by the pension fund.   slush fund in the news In July 2013, Spain's ruling Popular party faced accusations that it funded itself through secret and illegal donations from construction groups and other companies and used part of that money to set up a slush fund. The bulk of that fund was then allegedly used to make cash payments   in envelopes   to senior party leaders. In December 2012, the UK Serious Fraud Office was accused of operating a ""slush fund"" as a second secret payment to an outgoing executive was revealed. It transpired that the SFO was planning to pay as much as  475,000 to its chief operating officers Chris Bailes, when he stepped down at the end of the year. Labour's shadow attorney general said: ""The attorney general can't have been providing much oversight at teh SFO if it was being used as a slush fund under his very nose."""
small and medium enterprises SMEs,"The categorisation SME is designed to differentiate businesses with relatively small amounts of capital and/or personnel from larger organisations, particularly in relation to market segmentation, financial assistance or regulatory issues. Under EU law, a micro company has fewer than 10 employees and a turnover or balance sheet total no greater than  2m. A small company has less than 50 employees and turnover/balance sheet total no greater than  10m. A medium-sized company has fewer than 250 employees, a turnover no greater than  50m and a balance sheet totalof no more than  43m. Definitions of what constitutes an SME vary between different jurisdictions in the world.   SME in the news In November 2013 an FT writer pointed out that policy makers across the western world were trying to work out how to help SMEs because they realised  that SMEs underpinned most economies. One of the measures being considered was the introduction of negative interest rates because if banks themselves received a negative return on a central bank deposit they might be more inclined to invest the money elsewhere."

small private online course SPOC,"Small private online courses (Spocs) are a competing model to the Mooc (massive open online course). Despite much excitement about how Moocs might transform the education system, they have so far not been able to show how they will fund themselves. In addition, the ""open"" nature of the Mooc courses encourages large numbers of participants with very varied abilities because anyone with an internet connection can participate. This raises problems with assessment and therefore how much a Mooc can be worth on someone's curriculum vitae as they go on to jobs or further study.  Spocs offer some solution in that students are selected, which limits numbers of participants, and ensures they satisfy some entry requirements for the course. Spocs allow educational establishments to use them in a ""blended learning"" approach that combines classroom teaching with online learning.   Spoc in the news In April 2013 it was reported that NovoEd, a Mooc platform that had started life in Stanford University, would also offer limited-entry, closed courses, such as Stanford executive education programmes, alongside the Mooc courses."

smart beta,"Some investors are moving away from traditional market capitalisation-based indices to alternative strategies, known as smart beta, in search of better returns and lower costs amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic climate. [1] Smart beta is a rather elusive term in modern finance. It lacks a strict definition and is also sometimes known as advanced beta, alternative beta or strategy indices. It can be understood as an umbrella term for rules based investment strategies that do not use the conventional market capitalisation weights that have been criticised for delivering sub-optimal returns by overweighting overvalued stocks and, conversely, underweighting undervalued ones. Smart beta strategies attempt to deliver a better risk and return trade-off than conventional market cap weighted indices by using alternative weighting schemes based on measures such as volatility or dividends. [2] Smart beta refers to an investment style where the manager passively follows an index designed to take advantage of perceived systematic biases or inefficiencies in the market. It therefore costs less than active management, since there is less day-to-day decision-making for the manager, but since it will, at the very least, have higher trading costs than traditional passive management (which minimises those costs), it is a pricier option. [3] Among the best known alternatives to market cap weighting are the fundamentally weighted indices developed by Research Affiliates in 2005 which rank their constituents by book value, dividends, sales, and cash flow. However, even a naive weighting scheme such as equally weighted indices can be described as smart beta. Interest in smart beta indices has been fuelled by the global financial crisis of 2007-08 which prompted many investors to become more focused on controlling risks than simply maximising their returns.  One of the key attractions of smart beta is that it is less expensive for investors to evaluate the worth of these strategies than to analyse and monitor the performance of active managers. Smart beta can also be understood as the returns that can be generated from illiquid or private markets such as real estate and infrastructure which offer attractive risk return trade-offs and which can provide important diversification benefits when added to a conventional portfolio of equities and bonds. ExampleSome investors would also include thematic strategies under the smart beta umbrella by building portfolios that provide exposure to demographic trends or to particular sectors such as agriculture, timber and natural resources. [4] Smart beta options might include fundamental indexed investments or catastrophe bonds."
smart card,A small plastic card with an electronic chip that records and remembers information.  [1]
smart grid,"A smart grid uses information technology to manage electricity networks to promote energy efficiency and cost efficiency. One of the features of this system is the use of   smart meters  which tell consumers more about their electricity usage and allows utility companies to raise prices to give consumers an incentive to lower their electricity usage at peak times. [1] An example is that utilities can work with customers across a region to shut off air conditioning systems for short periods of time, reducing demand at peak times with little effect on a building s temperature. [2] Also known as electranet, the system would also allow people to generate their own electricity from renewable sources and sell it back to power suppliers. [3]"
smart growth,"Smart growth is originally a US term incorporating the American English meaning of the word smart to imply intelligent. When smart growth principles are applied to planning, new urban developments are designed so that shops and schools and places of work are within walking, or bicycling, distance of one another. The idea is to prevent huge areas of urban sprawl that have marred the suburbs of many western cities and to create sustainable communities instead. The European Commission borrowed the term smart growth to describe a decade-long planning vision established in 2010 called Europe 2020. The EC determines that smart growth means improving the EU's performance in education, research and innovation and in the digital society as a whole.   smart growth in the news In a joint letter to the FT in September 2012, ministers from Germany, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, outlined why they thought it was crucial to focus on reforms in Europe that would contribute to higher growth and employment. What Europe needed, they said, were smart growth policies."
smart meter,"A device that allows consumers to monitor energy consumption on a regular basis and in real-time. By immediately tracking their carbon emissions, in theory customers should be encouraged to turn off appliances when not in use and to curb their energy usage. Consequently, these actions should result in lower gas and electricity bills. The meters also send information about energy use straight to the suppliers to generate more accurate billing. [1] Smart meters also can offer consumers cheaper pricing on power when there is lower demand. In order to function, smart meters need real-time two-way communications technology, which allows data to be collected remotely, rather than having to send meter inspectors to check usage. Each meter will be linked via various technologies including SIM cards provided by telecoms groups, which could also be used to control other household utilities and functions over time. [2]   Smart meter in the news In August of 2013, the majority of the  2.8bn contract to provide the technology behind the national rollout of 53m  smart  utility meters across Britain has been awarded to Spain s Telef nica.The government wants every home in Britain to have a meter that can monitor and control electricity and gas to reduce power consumption, which is part of its long-term goal for a sustainable energy supply. However, by encouraging consumers to monitor their energy consumption, the government estimates that a dual-fuel household could on average see bill savings of  25 per year by 2020. The programme   one of the largest and most complex investment projects undertaken by the energy industry   has already been delayed by a year but it has been keenly fought over by companies in the telecoms sector in rounds of bidding.

smoothing,"Smoothing is a term used by accountants and actuaries to describe the legal process of dealing with changes in the value of a certain balance sheet entry or asset over a long period of time. By taking an average of all the different values, smoothing can deliver a constant figure for the shorter time periods that accountants and actuaries might need to consider.   smoothing in the news At the beginning of 2013, the UK's National Association of Pension Funds,  said a proposal to allow ""smoothing"" of gilt rates over two to three years, rather than using the prevailing rate, was not a good idea because once interest rates rose, schemes would be unable to take advantage of this in their valuations. The proposal from the Department of Work and Pensions in January 2013 had suggested that companies should be allowed to use the smoothed discount rate for liabilities.  A few months earlier, in October 2012, there was discussion over the use of smoothing to assess liabilities of US pension schemes.  It was reported that most public plans smooth their reported investment returns by taking an average of gains and losses over a number of years, typically three to five, but sometimes as many as 15. Moody s, the ratings agency, was proposing to ignore this and take the most recent market value for the size of a pension fund. Its raters would then impose a uniform discount rate, proposed at 5.5 per cent (based on Double-A corporate bond rates), when they calculate the size of promised benefits. The lower the number used, the larger those future payments look. So Moody s estimate of funding gaps would be far more conservative   ie larger   than public pension funds that use a discount rate of 7 per cent or 8 per cent."

social capital,"As its name suggests, social capital is an asset/capital. It is useful   a resource people use to accomplish things. But it is perhaps best understood when compared with human capital, a much older concept (which helped economist Gary Becker win a Nobel Prize). Human capital is comprised of the useful assets that are independently possessed by an individual: cleverness, charisma, technical skills. Social capital, on the other hand, is made up of resources available to an individual because of her/his network. They are assets the individual possesses only by virtue of the social relations that s/he develops and maintains. These relationships, of course, are often valued in themselves (friendships can provide tremendous happiness), but the focus of social capital tends to be on the ways in which social relations are a pathway to valuable assets that help people to accomplish things   examples of how social capital can bring benefits Social capital can offer alternative perspectives on a problem which spark creative solutions or directions (think of Steve Jobs  design savvy and its influence on Steve Wozniak s technical vision, and vice-versa, in shaping the direction of early personal computing and Apple) Social capital can offer ties to casual industry contacts which reveal job opportunities (it turns out that such weak ties, not strong ties, are remarkably valuable in job search[1]) Social capital provides access to political decision makers that speeds a stakeholder s business plans[2] The last example reminds us that social capital has legitimate but also illegitimate uses. How  private or  public  the good created, however, is underexplored and deserves attention. Social capital consists of many elements, but for simplicity, these elements fall into two categories: the structure of the network (mostly about the patterning of ties) and the quality of the relationships. One powerful theory[3] (with good empirical support) is that connections to disconnected others (bridging ties) are important to individual performance   even the performance of leaders[4].[1]    [1]Granovetter, M.S. 1973.

social commerce,"Social commerce and social shopping communities merge online shopping and social networking allowing people to actively participate in the marketing and selling of products and services.The distinction between social shopping and social commerce is that while social shopping connects customers, social commerce connects sellers.  The term social commerce is often used in practice to describe social shopping as well.Social commerce marketplaces tend to have four defining characteristics:(i) sellers are individuals instead of firms;(ii) sellers create product assortments organised as personalised online shops; (iii) sellers can create hyperlinks between their personalised shops; (iv) sellers  incentives are based on being paid commissions on sales made by their shops.What emerges is a consumer-driven online marketplace of personalised, individually-curated shops that are connected in a network. Links between sellers  shops in this network are hyperlinks that customers can use to move from shop to shop.ExamplesExamples of social commerce communities are Ebay MyWorld, Ebay neighborhoods, squidoo.com (for creating single web pages on your interests) and zlio.com (online stores creation site).

social enterprise,"A social enterprise is broadly defined as an enterprise that puts social benefit above or at least alongside profit. Traditionally these were non-profit organisations or charities with a philanthropic purpose, but they can also be structured as for-profit entities where profit is not the only overriding concern.   social enterprise in the news In April 2013 a report on the Queen's Awards for Enterprise, reported details of some of the winners of the sustainable development category. The writer noted that name of the category was changed from environmental achievement in 2001 to recognise organisations that not only addressed their environmental footprint, but that also looked at their social impact. Also in April 2013, it was reported that homes for homeless fund was seeking investors."
social entrepreneurship,"There is some debate among experts, including those offering teaching in social entrepreneurship, on what it actually is. For some, it is simply any business activity that creates social value   for example a business venture that generates environmental benefits, or provides education to underprivileged children in developing countries. For other proponents of social entrepreneurship, the focus is simultaneously on the entrepreneurship part of the term. For these people a social entrepreneur should also have launched a new company to deliver the social value.   social entrepreneurship in the news In March 2013 it was reported that Hub Westminster, a social enterprise incubator, was using its office space near Whitehall as a selling point for small businesses looking for access to government.  In February 2013, Pamela Hartigan, director of the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship at Said Business School, reviewed Conscious Capitalism, a book by John Mackey and Raj Sisodia. In the book it says conscious capitalism requires developing a higher purpose and core values alongside stakeholder integration."

social leader,"We use the term social leadership as coined by Esade Professor Jaume Filella. Social leaders have followers because of their ability to bring people together, facilitate agreements and drive efforts in the same direction. Nelson Mandela can be seen as the prototype of a social leader. Social leadership is especially necessary for groups of equals who have to accept changes, as is frequently the case in family businesses. Nobody else can force a family to change how they organise the business they own. Groups of siblings or cousins need social leadership to accept and integrate changes. A social leader needs to have an explicit agenda that consists in developing the whole system   the family business in this case   without any hidden agenda in terms of the leader s personal interest. The social leader must also be very legitimate, which means having a high degree of altruism. He or she must also have relational capabilities for dealing with the complexity of processes of change. Social leaders also need to have a high degree of self-esteem, because very often they are not recognised. The smoother and more crisis- and conflict-free the work, the better, but this means that the social leader s leadership is not easily recognised. Unlike other kinds of leaders, social leaders are hardly recognised at all. Their focus is on making change happen smoothly, and success means just that. It not obvious to a non-sensitive observer that someone has put the elements together to make things happen.[1]"
social marketing,"Marketing involved with ideas that are considered to be good for society, for example advertising that teaches people about the importance of protecting the environment. [1] "
social media,"Social media refers to the internet and mobile technology based channels of communication in which people share content with each other.  Examples are social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. In contrast to  social  media, earlier media channels made a clear distinction between a producer and a consumer of content. Since social media easily allows for a viewer of a video to share the same content with others, the boundary between consumers and producers is blurred. Example Businesses have realised both the potential and challenges associated with managing social media. While Dell delivered discount alerts on Twitter leading to sales, companies like Gap have encountered negative feedback when their attempt to change their logo backfired with people protesting against the new logo on Twitter and Facebook.

social media monitoring,"Social media monitoring is the active monitoring of social media channels for information about a company or organisation.Several different providers have created tools to facilitate the monitoring of a variety of social media channels from blogging to internet video to internet forums.  This allows companies to track what consumers are saying about their brands and actions. Companies can then react to these conversations and interact with consumers through social media platforms. Example Examples of companies that provide social media monitoring platforms include Radian6 and NetBase. Though they have different approaches to the problem, both Radian6 and NetBase provide their clients (market researchers and brand managers) tools that allow them to examine conversations that are happening on social media that are relevant to their brand.For instance, NetBase provides ""scorecards,"" which take a quick look at how well a brand is doing on social media, and a ""workbench,"" which gives companies the ability to dig a little deeper into these questions. Radian6, among other services, provides a number of different reports that cover everything from sentiment, to influence and to competitive analysis.

But as more choose to do so on internet forums and social networks such as Twitter and Facebook, they may be surprised to learn that hospitals and healthcare professionals are  listening in .Organisations such as the Care Quality Commission, the UK's health and social care regulator, and several NHS hospitals are starting to trawl the web for clues about where they need to investigate low standards or direct extra resources.Social media monitoring is becoming common in the private sector, as companies listen out for complaints about their own services, or those of competitors, to help poach customers.In the public sector,  eavesdropping  on online conversations can tap opinions from people who may not want to fill in a formal survey form.

social network,"This is a social structure consisting of individuals or groups who are connected to each other, for example through friendships.  When these connections are represented in a database and with a web interface, it is usually referred to as a  social network service  or simply  social networking . Social network services drastically reduce the barriers of entry and became extremely popular in the second half of the first decade of this century, as more people started to consider the web as the perfect place to keep in touch with their family, friends or acquaintances.  For example, Facebook, a social networking site that allows you to keep in touch with people in your life, reached 500 million active worldwide users in July 2010. Despite criticism,  generally social networks are not substituting  normal  life, but complementing it. ExampleSocial network services can be horizontal - for general use and with no clear purpose stated - or vertical - devoted to a specific activity or interest, as in  professional social networks  such as LinkedIn or dating services.

social relationship management,"Social relationship management is about keeping track of any mention of a company, its products, brands, or services and allows the company to manage its presence on the web with the required traceability, a consistent set of criteria and human intervention. ExampleCompanies use social relationship management to manage their active presence on the web, for example, engaging in relevant conversations with customers, the media, etc. Managing the rich and complex relationships and conversations on the web requires a careful combination of metrics, statistics, monitoring software and, of course, human intervention.

social tag,"Social tags are keywords generated by internet users on a platform that are used to describe and categorise an object, concept or idea.On some platforms, other users can also vote on tags that have already been added providing an additional social aspect to social tags.  One potential benefit of social tags is that they often provide a quick view into how users perceive something in social media, and can help a consumer quickly locate relevant information about the object.  This is one way to conduct social media monitoring.ExampleAmazon.com allows users to tag most of the products available on its website. A user might describe a book they just read with the tags of ""thriller,"" ""mystery"" and ""quick read.""Social tagging became popular in the realm of social bookmarking, where users share bookmarks to websites that they have discovered on a public platform, such as Digg, Del.icio.us and Reddit. In this context, users can add tags to describe the content of a webpage.The overall organisational structure that arises from the use of social tags is sometimes referred to as a folksonomy (as opposed to a taxonomy, which is a rigid, top-down organisational structure).  A folksonomy is a fluid classification system that is created by the work of many users (folks) as opposed to the rigid system created by experts.Social tags are sometimes grouped together into tag clouds, which are visual representations of the popularity of different social tags associated with the object. The more popular a tag, the larger the font size used to depict it.  The tags are often rotated and arranged in such a way as to resemble a cloud in the sky, hence the name. Many popular websites provide tag clouds to describe objects.  Last.fm   the digital music community site - displays tag clouds to describe musical artists. For example, British artist Adele is tagged as soul and singer-songwriter. [1] View A web 2.0 glossary"

socially responsible investing  SRI,"Investing only in companies, funds and other assets that meet certain standards in terms of social welfare, the environment, racial equality or other public issues."
socially responsible practice," This encompasses programmes and systems that a company can put in place to increase the safety and well-being of individuals.  Companies can seek to establish systems to ensure that human rights are upheld within the supplier network and to help improve the livelihood and welfare of its suppliers. In addition, companies can also improve the lives of employees by ensuring workplace safety, dealing with work-life balance issues.  Organisations can put socially responsible practices in place to improve customer safety and to educate consumers on how to use the products safely. Example Socially responsible practices affect business practices in various ways.  For instance: SuppliersSocially responsible practices ensure that suppliers:  do not use sweatshops, child and forced labour such as prisoners; pay their workers a living wage (that is above minimum wage).  EmployeesIn addition to specific safety rules that employees must abide by, worker-focused socially responsible practices include:  policies for hiring and retaining women and minorities; ways to employ disabled people into appropriate roles; subsidising gym memberships and meals in the workplace; providing training and funding for education.  CustomersSocially responsible practices include:  special packaging to prevent products from being tampered with; methods to educate consumers on proper storage, use and disposal of the product; giving customers the ability to track the product to ensure authenticity, providing contact details or a website for customers to talk to the company if they have any queries.  CommunityFinally, a company can invest in the community, in which it operates, to enhance relations. Companies can:  sponsor events or sports teams within the community; donate to local charities; encourage employees to engage in activities within the community; encourage staff to be advocates of specific charities and events during paid work time.

sociology of finance,"A trader cannot trade without a counterparty, therefore interaction between two individuals is essential for any financial transaction, and very often such trading interactions are reliant upon and mediated through various ICT systems and financial models.  These human and technology interactions force us to think about the sociology of finance.  Financial markets, which are social phenomena, are influenced, shaped, and affected by a variety of factors including the economic, historical, cultural, technical, legal, political, organisational, religious, geographical, environmental, emotional and/or natural events. This means, studying and understanding financial markets and transactions from financial or economic perspectives cannot convey the whole picture. As financial transactions and markets are fundamentally social phenomena we need to understand their existence and operation from a sociological point of view as well.  The sociology of finance is the systematic study of financial markets and transactions from a sociological perspective. The goal is to develop a rich and in-depth understanding of the financial markets from an interdisciplinary perspective.   sociology of finance in use If a private equity firm visits your office soliciting money for its forthcoming fund, what aspects would you as a limited partner take into consideration in evaluating the investment opportunity on your table  Experience, expertise, and cohesiveness of the management team, strategy, relationships maintained, reputation held, investment evaluation and decision making practices and procedures, focus of the fund (sectors, geographies, market segments), prior track record of the managers, contractual terms and conditions, fees, age of the investment professionals, etc are generally taken into consideration in evaluating private equity firms and their fund offerings.  Most of these are  social  aspects and qualitative in nature and their assessment involves high judgment. Other examples would be the traders relying very heavily on computer modeling and ICT.  Sociological investigation is extremely helpful in understanding these and other financial market settings.[1]"

sovereign bonds,"Sovereign bonds are bonds issued by governments. They can be either local-currency-denominated or denominated in a foreign currency. Sovereign bonds and sovereign debt can be used interchangeably, but sovereign debt can also refer to the total outstanding stock of a country's government debt. Example The recent Greek crisis is one of too much sovereign debt.  With so much debt, under reasonable assumptions, this calls into question the government's ability and willingness to repay the loans. The market's response has been to sell Greek sovereign bonds, driving up their yield, hence Greek borrowing costs, and driving their prices lower. [1] View IMF focus on Europe irks emerging markets In-depth: Greek debt crisis Interactive timeline: Greek debt crisis"
sovereign debt,"This is debt that is issued by a national government. It is theoretically considered to be risk-free, as the government can employ different measures to guarantee repayment, e.g. increase taxes or print money. In practice, there have been multiple cases in which governments could not serve their debt obligations and had to default. As a consequence, investors ask for different yields across countries. The more a country's repayment ability is in question and the riskier sovereign debt becomes, the higher is its yield.  Sovereign debt differs within and across countries e.g. by its maturity, the currency in which it is issued and whether it offers nominal or real interest rates. ExampleThe stability and growth pact of the European countries that introduced and have used the Euro as their national currency requires each country to maintain a national sovereign debt level that is below (or approaching) 60 per cent of the country's GDP. Fears about the ability of several European countries to serve their debt obligations in the spring of 2010 led to substantial increases in the yields of sovereign debt issued by these countries. The European Union along with the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund reacted by designing a rescue package worth  750 billion.

spear phishing,"Spear phishing is the use of highly personalised emails by hackers to create initial footholds on victims' networks. These spear-phishing emails are often well written and appear to be sent from a personal associate of the target.Typically, if a target replies they might receive a perfectly reasonable response back which would encourage the trust of the target. A subsequent email might then include an email attachment that would launch a malicious program.   spear phishing in the news In February 2013, the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and Twitter all said that hackers had either attempted to gain access or succeeded in gaining access to their systems.  A likely method of hacking might have seen employees tricked into visiting an infected website by a  spear phishing  email that was designed specifically for its individual recipient, experts said. In July 2012, the US Department of Homeland Security was quoted as that spear phishing was now the most common method of cyber attack. "

spin-off,"The creation of a separate company from part of an existing firm. There could be several reasons for such a move - for example a strategy to dispose of non-core assets, or an attempt to unlock a division's value by giving it a more independent management structure and possibly attracting outside investment. Shareholders of the parent company would normally receive a proportionate number of shares in the new entity. If the parent company decides to sell only a minority stake in the business, the exercise is called a partial spin-off. [1] A spin-off is also a company whose business is based on products or technology initially developed in a parent company, university or research institution. ExamplePlant Genetic System (PGS) was founded in 1983 by two professors at Ghent University (Belgium).

That technology, which was developed within the university, served as the basis for the success of PGS.  In 1985, PGS was the first company to develop genetically engineered tobacco plants with insect tolerance. [2]"

sponsored search advertising,"In sponsored search, when a consumer searches for a term using a search engine, the advertisers' webpage appears as a sponsored link next to the organic search results that would otherwise be returned using the neutral criteria employed by the search engine. Companies that wish to advertise their products or services in this way submit product information in the form of specific keyword listings to search engines. Bid values are assigned to each individual advert to determine the position of each competing listing on the search engine results page when a user performs a search.  By allotting a specific value to each keyword, advertisers only pay the assigned price for the users who actually click on their listing to visit their websites in the most prevalent payment mechanism, known as cost per click (CPC). Search engines leverage their value as information-locating tools by selling advertising linked to user-generated queries and referring consumers to the advertisers, and such sponsored-search advertising has become the most predominant form of online advertising. Example If someone searched for 'bed sheets' on Google, Yahoo or Bing, advertisers such as Macy's,  J. C. Penney, Amazon and so on might show up with their sponsored ads in response to that query.

In underwriting, the difference between what the issuer receives from the underwriter and what the underwriter receives from the public (underwriting spread)."
spread betting,"A financial spread bet is a way of trading on an asset, such as a share or a commodity, or even an entire market, such as the FTSE 100 index, without having to physically own that asset. Spread betting involves taking two-way bets on the movement on assets such as foreign exchange, stock indices and commodity prices. An investor may make a bet while the spread betting firm acts as the counter party. The spread betting firm quotes buying and selling prices in 'points' based on the actual price of the asset in the market, and you, the investor, bet on those prices. Every point that moves in your favour results in a win in multiples of your stake - and every point against you results in a loss of multiples of your stake.                If you think that an asset will rise in value, then you 'buy' the spread bet and aim to sell it at a higher price. This is known as ""going long"". If you think that an asset will fall in value, then you would 'sell' it and aim to buy it back at a cheaper price. This is known as going short. You can close a spread bet at any time when the spread betting firm is making a price, to realise a profit or loss, by taking out an opposite bet of the same initial stake. [1], [2]   spread betting in the news In December 2013 it was reported that the pool of people spread betting in the UK had shrunk by 8 per cent over 2013, according to research firm Investment Trends. The decrease in numbers of spread betters was put down to improved sentiment in UK shares meaning investors no longer felt they had to try to cash in on market volatility."
spread compression,"When a bond price goes up its yield goes down. The spread on bonds is usually expressed as the difference between bonds of the same maturity but different quality, for example the difference between the yield on a 10-year Treasury vs the yield on 10-year corporate bond. Spread compression is said to have occurred when the yield on a previously higher-yielding bond comes down due to strong demand.   spread compression in the news At the end of 2012 spread compression on emerging market debt was leading some experts to believe that demand for EM debt was overwhelming supply and leading to mispricing and the risk of exposure should US Treasury yields rise. However, the head of emerging market debt at one fund manager said he believed that more spread compression would have to take place before it could be declared a bubble."

squeezed middle,"The ""squeezed middle"" is that section of society deemed to be most affected by inflation and tax rises because they are in jobs that deliver low to middle incomes which have not been rising as fast as their expenses (or, in some cases, not rising at all). In the years of austerity following the financial crisis, politicians in all developed countries were keen to declare their support for the squeezed middle because of their perceived moral high ground   as opposed to those on high incomes and the unemployed. In reality, despite their declared support for the squeezed middle, politicians in power, in deciding to pursue austerity measures, effectively squeezed this section of society more. The term is, however, notoriously ill-defined in respect of exactly where the middle begins and ends, a fact that has caused further argument among politicians.   squeezed middle in the news In January 2012 the Resolution Foundation, a UK think-tank that focuses on the squeezed middle, forecast that the squeezed middle would remain an important political battleground because real incomes were being squeezed even further by government austerity moves. In October 2012 the group brought together the Commission on Living Standards. It warned that without urgent action, by 2020 these low to middle earners   a pivotal group of swing voters for all parties   would have seen their incomes reduce further. In February 2013, shadow UK prime minister Ed Miliband delivered a speech outlining measures that he would introduce if elected that would redistribute cash to the ""squeezed middle"".

The pact sets a limit for government budget deficits of 3 per cent of gross domestic product in normal times.  The European Commission acts as the guardian of the pact and can recommend that governments take specific policy measures to bring their deficits under control. Governments that repeatedly violate the pact and ignore the recommendations can be subject to fines, but only with the approval of EU member-states. No country has ever been fined since the euro's launch in 1999. [1] The rulebook was drawn up in the 1990s for eurozone members as an alternative to fiscal union.

staggered board,"A staggered board is a governance practice in which only a fraction (typically a third) of the members of the board of directors is elected each year, rather than all at once.

ExampleThe recent U.S. initiative to replace disposable plastic bags with resuable cloth bags for grocery shopping is an example of stakeholder marketing. Although consumers need to buy the cloth bags the first time around, they feel better about themselves as they are seen to be contributing to a more sustainable planet.

stakeholder theory,"Stakeholder theory suggests that the purpose of a business is to create as much value as possible for stakeholders. In order to succeed and be sustainable over time, executives must keep the interests of customers, suppliers, employees, communities and shareholders aligned and going in the same direction. Innovation to keep these interests aligned is more important than the easy strategy of trading off the interests of stakeholders against each other. Hence, by managing for stakeholders, executives will also create as much value as possible for shareholders and other financiers. ExampleAn example of how executives create value for stakeholders is the IBM s Smarter Planet campaign.  As part of the campaign, the company helped the Memphis Police Department reduce crime by 27 per cent from 2006 to 2010 by developing a computer system  that unifies and analyses a huge amount of crime data. This benefits not only their customer, i.e., the police department, but also the entire Memphis community.  [1]"

stalking horse,"An offer or bid designed to test the market for an asset often ahead of a formal auction. A stalking horse bid effectively places a floor underneath a proposed asset sale.

ExampleIn 2009, Nokia Siemens agreed a $650m stalking horse offer for Nortel Networks' main wireless assets ahead of a formal auction. Ericsson eventually won the auction by agreeing to pay $1.13bn for the assets, outbidding Nokia Siemens and a third bidder.  [1]"
stamp duty and stamp duty land tax,"Stamp duty land tax (SDLT) has applied since 1 December 2003 when it replaced stamp duty on UK land and buildings. SDLT is charged in bands which increase as the value of the property increases. SDLT was restructured on purchases of residential property with effect from 4 December 2014 so that the charge is now made at different rates depending on the portion of the purchase price that falls within each rate band. SDLT on non-residential property is still calculated as a  slab tax  whereby a single rate, determined by the value, is applicable to the whole amount. As an anti-avoidance measure, where high value residential property is acquired by a 'non-natural person' (such as a company) a significantly higher rate of SDLT applies. The annual tax on enveloped dwellings will also apply to such property. Stamp duty at 0.5 percent of the price paid applies to transfers of UK shares irrespective of value. Stamp duty reserve tax instead of stamp duty is levied on transactions carried out through electronic share dealing systems (also at 0.5 percent). From 28 April 2014 stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax were abolished on shares quoted on recognised growth markets, such as the Alternative Investment Market and the ISDX Growth Market. [1]"

strategic alliance,"A legal agreement between two distinct organisations that provides for sharing resources collaboratively in pursuit of a mutually beneficial goal.Strategic alliance agreements are common in the biotechnology sector, where large pharmaceutical organisations sponsor research activities at small, often start-up, research companys.  These small organisations often excel in a particular research discipline, but lack the sales, marketing and distribution resources to bring their innovations to market. Likewise, the large organisations may lack specialised research knowledge in a specific research discipline.  A strategic alliance in this setting may take the following form: the pharmaceutical company sponsors research at the small company by either direct cash payments or through a purchase of equity.  This may be combined with a revenue sharing agreement that allows the small company to receive a fraction of any proceeds arising from commercialised products that use their research output. By forming a strategic alliance, the organisations share resources to their mutual gain. Example The 2009 strategic alliance agreement between Monsanto and GrassRoots Biotechnology is a recent example of an alliance between a large company and small research-focused organisation.  Monsanto is a globally recognised agriculture company.  GrassRoots Biotechnology is a small, research-oriented agricultural biotechnology company.  The Monsanto/ Grassroots strategic alliance agreement called for GrassRoots to conduct research on Monsanto s behalf. Strategic alliances also occur in many other business settings.   The strategic alliance between the Dutch airline KLM and the American carrier Northwest Airlines is a famous example of a strategic alliance that allowed two companies to share their routing networks but still remain distinct companies.

strategic communication,"Communication is strategic when it is completely consistent with a corporation s mission, vision, values and is able to enhance the strategic positioning and competitiveness of the organisation. The most important concept to understand in relation to communication strategy is that communication should be seen from the audience s perspective. One way to think about this is each time a person or organisation communicates, they should ask themselves the following question:  As a result of this communication, my audience will   Interviews with chief executive officers and other c-suite executives, such as the chief financial officer, show that strategic communication must be clear, true, repeated, consistent and delivered with passion. Corporations choose to communicate strategically due exogenous crises, internal corporate crises and other situations including:  regulatory imperatives such as Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD), this law says that you have to tell everyone material information (such as something that can affect stock price) at the same time (tell one tell all).  That means you cannot say one thing to your investors, and another thing to you customers; dynamic constituent expectations about how the organisation should be run because audiences, or constituencies, change their opinions, therefore their expectations can be difficult to meet. short-term orientation of senior management, who are typically in jobs for less than five years.  The average tenure for a chief executive officers is four and a half years and for a chief marketing officer it is 18 months.  Naturally, they are going to have a short-term orientation rather than being able to plan and work for the long term. organisational complexity due to muliple locations and size of operations and various constituencies who may have very different goals and needs, such as customers and employees, so an organisation may have to deal with conflicting interests.  Example Starbucks maintains its socially responsible image by partnering with NGOs, increasing its own transparency when they faced challenges based on how it sources coffee.

strategic innovation,"Innovative strategies alone - without changes to either the underlying technologies or the products and services sold to customers - drive the success of many companies, such as Ikea.  Strategic innovation is about innovating the strategy itself. Strategy involves answers to three basic questions that define a business: 1) Who are our customers 2) What value do we provide 3) How do we deliver that value  As such, strategic innovation involves one or more of the following:  Dramatic redefinition of the customer base - that is, how do we dramatically expand the size of the market  For example, Apple made personal computers for individuals at a time when computers were used by corporations, scientific establishments, educational institutes and governments.  Dramatic reinvention of the concept of customer value - that is, how do we dramatically change the value customers receive   For example, as well as selling hardware, IBM moved into supplying total business solutions.  Dramatic redesign of the end-to-end value chain architecture - that is, how do we dramatically improve the efficiency of the end-to-end value chain from suppliers to customers.  For example, Ikea uses standardisation (meaning making one type of a product) as a route to become the world s largest furniture retailer.  For suppliers and customers, Ikea's standard flat pack furniture enables efficient transportation of these items. In a world that is changing rapidly and in unpredictable ways, strategic innovation becomes vital to adapt to change. [1]"

strategy innovation,"This often involves changing or innovating the business models   the template on how the firm is going to make money - to make a company more competitive. Strategy innovation requires changing or bringing new value propositions, services and production processes. There are four different types of strategy innovation a) The first one is imitation, where there is little or only marginal innovation involved. In this scenario, companies mimic value propositions and business processes currently known in the industry. The success of such an approach may depend on factors that are external to the company   such as industry growth. In a growing industry, for example consumer electronic goods sector, there may be opportunities for many imitators. Examples of such products are tablets, the portable computer devices, and there are various brands on the market including Apple s iPad, Samsung s Galaxy and Motorola Xoom. Generally, the consumer electronics goods sector, but probably not at the high-end, profits are often transitory, as competitive differences between the companies in the industry are minimal or non-existent b) A second type of strategy innovation is market-based strategy innovation that is focused on bringing value propositions new to the industry or by diversifying into neighbouring markets and segments by seeking demand for different products and services in the sector. For instance, Nintendo s ability to make a success out of the Wii was partly due to the fact that it made games (consoles) for a wider market. Instead of just producing games, they created a wide-range of applications, such as fitness and exercise programmes for the Wii, making use of a board that weighs you and monitors the movement of your body when you stand on it.  The underlying technologies that went into creating the Wii were not entirely new, but the value proposition and the market definition was new to the industry.  Market definition here involves issues of who the customer is, and what does she want in terms of features, prices, access, and delivery. c) In contrast, the third type of strategy innovation, namely technology-based innovation involves using management processes and technologies not seen in the industry. Reconfiguring the activity chain and system by Toyota meant that the company had a critical look at the way cars were designed, developed, manufactured and retailed. This then led to a more effective and efficient set of internal activities and management practices such as just-in-time approaches that were interfaced with external supplier and distribution activities. Such an approach by Toyota, particularly in relation to its manufacturing system, shifted the advantage in the industry in its favour, as a result of increased efficiency and productivity at its car plants. The cars that were manufactured by Toyota were not particularly innovatively designed or targeted a new segment   they were targeted at the same mass market segments as the rest of the industry, but the reconfiguration of the activity chain allowed Toyota to gain an advantage by providing well-crafted and quality products, in comparison to what its main competitors offered at that time. d) The final type, market and technology-based innovation involves combining value propositions new to the industry or creating a new market with the help of technology and new ideas. Groupon, the social networking-based group purchasing website provides a new way of offering discounts to its customers who are also subscribers of the site. Deals cover meals in restaurants and beauty treatments. Subscribers buy time-limited vouchers online for local businesses.  Groupon keeps half the money and the rest goes to the business (which also gets a lot of new customers). A specific number of people must sign up to activate the discount.  Groupon's success is due to users referring the site to friends over Facebook. [1] The company s dramatic growth reflects its early success in building a market-leading position on the internet s new frontier   the highly fragmented but lucrative market for advertising, coupons and other marketing from local businesses that was once dominated by local newspapers and Yellow Pages directories. It has done so with a pay-for-performance model, made possible by the internet, that goes beyond the traditional marketing methods used to win new customers. ""It is all performance based,"" says Mason [CEO of Groupon]. ""They are only paying for the customers that come through the door. There s never been anything like that before, and that s why I think we ve been so successful.  [3] Groupon is making money by giving companies a new opportunity to market themselves and gain new customers - the value proposition - by using social networking and the latest technology. In other words, a whole new market with its value propositions, activity models and ecosystem.

stress tests,"These are attempts to gauge the health of banks by running disaster scenarios and seeing if they survive. [1] Ever since banks collapsed   many of them due to a lack of liquidity, regulators have been running regular six-monthly tests on their big banks. The irony is that they focus not on liquidity stress but on capital stress. In other words, whether a bank is solvent rather than whether it has financing to operate day to day. ExampleIn 2010, with banks across the continent among the biggest owners of sovereign debt, the idea was to launch a transparent stress-test exercise on 91 of the biggest banks. The Spaniards were very keen on this idea, because many of their banks, particularly the public-sector cajas, or savings banks, had overstretched themselves with big property lending, which had gone bad as the Spanish property market collapsed. The rumours about sovereign debt problems threatened to break them. Just as a scarcity of liquid funding in the markets killed Lehman Brothers and other banks round the world, so a similar threat hung over Spain. Lately many banks have only been able to finance their operations via emergency facilities at the European Central Bank. It had a tough job persuading the rest of Europe, Germany in particular, to make the tests pan-European.

[1] "
structural deficit,"A budget deficit that results from a fundamental imbalance in government receipts and expenditures, as opposed to one based on one-off or short-term factors. [1] A government budget deficit occurs when a government spends more than it receives in tax revenue, while a structural deficit is when a budget deficit persists for some time. Structural deficits will eventually pose a problem for any government. Deficits are financed by borrowing, and continued borrowing leads to an accumulation of debt. The ability to pay off this debt is measured by a country s debt relative to its GDP, referred to as its debt-to-GDP ratio. If a country s debt-to-GDP ratio gets too high, investors will worry that the government will either default on this debt, or will deflate its value away by monetising the debt and thereby engineer a high inflation rate. ExampleA number of European countries in 2011, such as Greece and Spain, are now facing structural deficits leading to a crisis of confidence regarding their ability to pay off this debt. The point at which a structural deficit and rising debt-to-GDP ratio can lead to a crisis of confidence depends on the credibility of a country. A country with a long history of not defaulting on its debt will endure large deficits without a financial crisis. The US, for instance, has large structural deficits but is still able to borrow at very low interest rates. While the UK s debt-to-GDP ratio has hovered around 40% from 1980 to 2007, since then it has doubled to 80% due to recent large deficits. [2]"

sukuk (Islamic bonds)," Islamic bonds, structured in such a way as to generate returns to investors without infringing Islamic law (that prohibits riba or interest). Sukuk represents undivided shares in the ownership of tangible assets relating to particular projects or special investment activity. A sukuk investor has a common share in the ownership of the assets linked to the investment although this does not represent a debt owed to the issuer of the bond. In the case of conventional bonds the issuer has a contractual obligation to pay to bond holders, on certain specified dates, interest and principal. In contrast, under a sukuk structure the sukuk holders each hold an undivided beneficial ownership in the underlying assets. Consequently, sukuk holders are entitled to a share in the revenues generated by the Sukuk assets. The sale of sukuk relates to the sale of a proportionate share in the assets.[1] Since the beginning of 2000, sukuk have become important Islamic financial instruments in raising funds for long-term project financing. The first sukuk were issued by Malaysia in 2000, followed by Bahrain in 2001.  Since then sukuk have been used by both the corporate sector and states for raising alternative financing.  While sukuk issuance was affected by the global financial crisis, since 2011, sukuk have been growing in popularity. [2] Example There are various types of sukuk structures relating to the nature of the underlying asset. The most commonly used is where the sukuk relates to a partial ownership of an asset (sukuk al-ijarah). Other types of these bonds relate to partial ownership in in a debt (sukuk murabaha), project (sukuk al-istisna), business (sukuk al-musharaka), or investment (sukuk al-istithmar). By 2011 over more than $19bn had been raised through 30 issues of sukuk bonds on the London Stock Exchange. [3] "

In the first year, a charge will be taken equal to 5/15 of the total cost of the asset (minus its salvage value). In the second year, a charge equal to 4/15 will be taken. In the third year, 3/15, etc."

super angel,"Angel investors play a very essential role in the innovation ecosystem.  Many are former successful entrepreneurs, which provided them with the liquidity to invest in other early stage companies. They take on very high levels of risk as they are typically the first equity investors in innovative start-up companies, and invest in advance of institutional venture capitalists. This is referred to as a ""seed"" round. In general, they invest their own capital and provide strategic counsel to the founding team based on their prior entrepreneurial experience The term Super Angel refers to two very specific types of angel investors. The more common and traditional term refers to angel investors who are prolific in their investment activities and who have made seed stage investments in a large number of start-up ventures using their own capital. Well known Silicon Valley Super Angels include both the very low profile angel investor Keith Rabois, founder of Slide (acquired by Google), who has played many key roles in the Valley, including COO of Square and who recently joined the top tier firm Khosla Ventures in February 2013, and the high profile Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, until he joined VC firm Greylock, and Mark Andreesen, founder of Netscape and LoudCloud, until he formed the highly influential institutional venture capital firm Andreesen-Horowitz. Well known Boston Super Angels include Bill Warner, founder of Avid and Wildfire.  Well known New York City Super Angels include David Frankel,  Founder of Internet Solutions, until he formed the Founders Collective.  super angel - some recent developments More recently, Super Angel has taken on a second meaning. In this instance, it refers to highly sophisticated and well-connected angel investors who have been uniquely successful as individual angels and who have earned access to superior deal flow. In this case, they begin to either pool capital with trusted colleagues or raise capital from friends and close business associates and then invest from this pool of capital.  This new form of Super Angel is still largely a Silicon Valley phenomenon. While there are a number of these new groups, Ron Conway, along with Peter Theil, are leaders of the most well known and prolific Super Angel groups. Conway s group, SV Angel, has been especially active. Their portfolio is a true Who s Who of SV icons such as Google, Paypal and Twitter and emerging giants including Foursquare and Square. Peter Theil, Founder of Paypal, and his group, the Founders Fund, are equally active and successful.  Their investments include icons such as Facebook, SpaceX , Yammer (acquired by Microsoft) and Mint.com (acquired by Intuit) and emerging giants including Spotify. Other well known Silicon Valley Super Angels include Dave McClure of 500 StartUps, investors in Udemy and SlideShare,  and Mike Maples Jr, son of former Microsoft COO Mike Maples Sr. whose group is known as Floodgate and who was an early investor in Twitter and Digg. One notable Boston/NYC-based Super Angel group, the Founder Collective, includes Caterina Fake, co-founder of both Flickr (acquired by Yahoo) and Hunch, and Chris Dixon, founder of Site Advisor (sold to McAfee) and Co-Founder of Hunch and David Frankel, founder of  Internet Solutions. As angel investors play an increasingly important role in the era of cloud based services and the cash efficient Lean Start-Up, and as all but the most successful institutional VCs struggle to raise capital, we can expect to see continued growth in this important new form of investor.  They will increasingly provide the jet fuel powering the growth of the Innovation Economy.[1] "

super voting right,"Extra voting rights, usually five or ten votes for each share, that someone who owns a particular class of shares in a company has. Shares with super voting rights are usually held by company directors or by the person who first established a company. [1] "
super-Pac,"The Citizens United Supreme Court decision loosened the restrictions on who can give how much to political action committees (pac), giving rise to what has become known as  super-Pacs . [1] Super-Pacs are groups that may spend unlimited amounts to influence elections but may not co-ordinate with their chosen candidate s campaign. [2] They are technically independent, but can run advertisements for or against any candidate or issue. In reality, however, each candidate has a super-Pac that supports them and few voters can tell the difference between ads run by a candidate s campaign and those by the super-Pac of its supporters. These groups can raise unlimited amounts of money from corporations, unions, trade groups and individuals, with very loose rules dictating how and which contributions must be disclosed. ExampleMany super-Pacs, such as Karl Rove s American Crossroads, have created sister  charity  organisations to filter money through to further muddy the origins of their contributions. [3] Up to the end of 2011, the super-political action committees set up to support President Barack Obama and Democrats running for Congress had raised $4.4m. In the space of a single week, a super-Pac backing Newt Gingrich in his bid for the Republican presidential nomination raised more than double that.

super-injunction,"Super-injunctions are a kind of legal  gagging order  that not only block the media from reporting the details of a story, the parties seeking the order, but also prevent journalists from mentioning the existence of the injunction. There is debate over the increased use of super-injunctions, after MPs named those protected by court orders, including Sir Fred Goodwin, former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland. Part of the controversy revolves around the fact that super-injunctions are granted to individuals on a case-by-case basis by judges, leading to suggestions that the judiciary   rather than an elected government   has been creating a privacy law.  Several celebrities have been granted super-injunctions by judges to prevent newspapers from publishing details of their personal lives. However, their effectiveness was compromised by updates on Twitter, the social media network, where some users named celebrities alleged to have taken out super-injunctions. ExampleThe married footballer Ryan Giggs was named, on May 23 2011, as the celebrity at the centre of a  super-injunction  controversy in the UK. This added fuel to a hotly-contested debate around the right to privacy against the right to freedom of speech.  The disclosure was made by by John Hemming, a Liberal Democrat member of parliament who used parliamentary privilege to identify the Manchester United player in the House of Commons.

supercomputer,"Supercomputers are massive computers which have more processing power and faster speeds than any other computers in the world. The father of supercomputing is said to be Seymour Cray who founded Cray Research in 1972. The first Cray-1 system was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976. It boasted a world-record speed of 160 million floating-point operations per second (160 megaflops) and an 8 megabyte (1 million word) main memory. In 1993 Cray unveiled its first massively parallel processing system and in 1995 the first supercomputer to sustain one teraflop (one trillion floating-point operations per second) on a real-world application.    supercomputer in the news In June 2013, it was revealed that China could be on the verge of supercomputer domination with the revelation that its Tianhe 2 (or Milky Way 2) had shot to number one with twice the power and more than five times the processing cores of its nearest rival. The top 500 list revealed at the International Supercomputing Conference, said Tianhe 2 could run at 55 petaflops. The FT reported that China s lead suggests it could be the first to cross the line in an international race to achieve exaflop computing   1,000 times faster than the current petaflop era   by 2020.  As a country the US still dominated the top 500, however, with 252 of the supercomputers on the list. China, with 66 systems, and Japan, with 30 systems, were second and third."

supplementary capital,
supplementary charge,"The supplementary charge is an additional payment by oil companies producing oil or gas in the UK or in the UK Continental Shelf. It is charged as if it was corporation tax on the company (in addition to corporation tax) and is charged on certain adjusted profits generated by a company on its oil and gas exploration and production activities (ring fence profits). Financing costs are not deductible for the supplementary charge. [1]   supplementary charge in the news North Sea oil producers will benefit from a sharp cut in taxes worth after the UK chancellor slashed the headline supplementary rate on profits - announced in the UK Budget 2015. This is a move that could give some ageing fields a new lease of life. The chancellor said he would reduce the supplementary charge on oil and gas companies, levied on top of a 30 per cent corporation tax rate, from 30 to 20 per cent. The change was backdated to January 1, 2015. [2]"
supplier,A company that provides a particular type of product. [1] 
supply,The amount of a good or service that is available for sale. The relationship between supply and demand determines the price of the product.
supply and demand,"The relationship between the amount of products and services that are for sale and the amount that people want to buy, especially in the way this affects prices. [1] "
supply chain distance,"Supply chain distance refers to the geographical, cultural and organisational distance between supply chain partners.  This is an important for firms to consider as it can have an impact on its performance and the ability to serve its customers.  First, geographical distance is the physical separation between the organisation and its suppliers. For example, companies with suppliers located in different countries tend to have a large geographical distance between each other.   Second, cultural distance reflects the differences between the cultures of the societies in which the company and its suppliers are located.  Cultural distance influences how managers confront new or challenging problems and develop working relationships. Discussions about expectations and future plans are easier to facilitate when an organisation and its suppliers are based in societies with similar cultures. Finally, organisational distance is the total number of companies that are in the supply chain, and this increases as the number of firms in the supply chain increase.  Potential problems can arise as communication is conducted between lots of parties and important information may get  lost in translation.  This means some companies establish formal codes of conduct that lay out specific expectations and set basic standards that suppliers have to adhere to. A company in Europe might source from either Brazil or Thailand, both roughly equivalent in geographic distance, but are very different culturally. So, the company would have to put practices in place to help avoid potential misunderstandings and ensure that suppliers function in a way that the firm is used to from its operations in Europe. One thing to consider is the cultural expectations in the sourcing country, which may not be well understood by suppliers outside the market. If the company is located in a developed country and sources from developing countries, the sourcing country must conform to cultural expectations (and regulations) of the developed country. For instance, child labour is not used in developed countries, and thus would expect that suppliers in the developing country not to use child labor. When sourcing from countries that are distant both geographically and culturally, some companies have opened  purchasing  offices in China to help them deal with their Chinese suppliers. A purchasing office is set up by a company in the supplier country to identify suppliers and work directly with them. By having its own employees in the country and without the need to rely on contractors or outside intermediaries, the company will be able to explain better their needs and requirements to their suppliers, but also keep tighter control on their suppliers  actions. It also reduces the number of firms in the supply chain as the firm sources directly from China rather than dealing with a third party. [1] Example In 2010, efforts by the US to force China to allow the renminbi to appreciate could be bad news for European companies buying Chinese goods. A more stronger renminbi makes goods purchased from China more expensive. As if this were not enough to contend with, inflation in China s labour market has returned in 2010 after an absence of about three years. Strikes, in that year, over pay underlined the demand for higher wages, which can be one of the biggest costs of manufacturing. Retailers in particular, in an effort to manage the inflation in the supply chain, are moving to cheaper Asian locations. But sourcing from less developed markets exposes companies to another set of risks. These range from managing quality to ensuring the supply chain is free from child labour. Primark, the European retail group, whose supply chain has come under scrutiny, is taking a number of steps to improve its ethical sourcing. These include audits of its overseas suppliers, which look at areas such as health and safety, that workers are of a legal age and that they are being paid an adequate wage. It is also working with non-governmental organisations in the countries where its garments are made, and increasing its own staff there. [2] ViewSupply chain: Distance can add danger as well as value "
supply chain finance,"Supply chain finance allows a supplier to sell its invoices to a bank at a discount as soon as they are approved by the buyer. That allows the buyer to pay later and the supplier to secure its money earlier. Instead of relying on the creditworthiness of the supplier, the bank deals with the buyer   usually a less risky prospect. Supply chain finance is seen by many supply chain experts and managers as the great hope for easing problems with suppliers. Although it actually refers to several different solutions, at its most basic it allows both the buying company and the supplier to improve their working capital   a crucial attribute given the recent financial crisis. Companies such as J Sainsbury, Nestl , Syngenta, retailer Metro and truckmaker Volvo have all used it.ExampleThe way it works at KPN (Dutch telecoms group) is typical. The group pays its suppliers later, improving its own working capital by holding on to its money for longer.But suppliers can now access their invoices to KPN on an internet platform and sell them on to a bank as soon as they are approved. That means they can get their money almost three months ahead, against the payment of a fee they need to pay the bank. The bank eventually collects the money from the buyer on the official payment date. Win-win  is a term used by many in supply chain finance. Both sides improve their working capital while the banks get a fee. It looks similar to the widely used practice of factoring but the main difference is that the risk is transferred from a group of buyers to one, usually more creditworthy, buyer. It also tends to be cheaper as the supplier essentially uses the buyer s credit rating, and the risk for the bank is low as the invoices have been confirmed by the buyer. [1]ViewFinancial sweetener for suppliers"
supply chain management,"While companies act as individual entities in areas such as financial reporting and management, they are also members of broader supply chains.  Supply chains link members together in the quest to add value to raw materials in stages until products are finally ready to be sold to customers. There are lots of definitions of supply chain management (SCM), but this is one from the Council of SCM Professionals:  SCM encompasses the planning and controlling of all processes involved in procurement, conversion, transportation and distribution across a supply chain. SCM includes coordination and collaboration between partners, which can be suppliers, intermediaries, third party service providers, and customers.  In essence, SCM integrates supply and demand management within and between companies in order to serve the needs of the end-customer . Example The challenge of SCM is the sheer breadth of coordinating processes across supply chains from raw material to end-customers.  Cisco Systems comments ""increasing customer demands, competition, and rising development costs are changing the face of business. To stay competitive, companies must transform their supply chains from cost-based, back-office functions to flexible operations designed to effectively address today's challenges"" (interview by Paul Taylor with Kevin O Marah, chief strategy officer at Gartner). While the role of purchasing has traditionally been limited to cost reduction, the opportunity today is for buyers, suppliers, and distributors to work more closely together.  The internet has opened up many opportunties to facilitate the sharing of information and a better focus on the end customer needs.  In other words, companies such as Cisco today see SCM as crucial to competing in tomorrow s market places. [1] ViewImportance of the supply chain Supply chain is a strategic discipline   "
supply chain power,"This represents the extent to which a company has influence on other members of the supply chain.  A supply chain is the network of various companies that are involved in the sourcing, manufacture and delivery of products and services, from extracting raw materials to final consumption. Let us consider shirts, there are many companies involved in the production of this item, such as the manufacturer of the fabric, the cotton supplier and the farmers managing the cotton plant.  Effective coordination and collaboration among channel partners provides a quality product at a competitive price delivered on time. Example The most powerful companies in the supply chain can push changes onto its suppliers which can have a profound impact on the company and the industry as a whole. According to an FT article, 'Wal-Mart sees jump in CFL sales', in 2006 the US retail giant Wal-Mart set itself the goal of selling 100m low-energy light bulbs by 2007.  Within a year, the percentage of its customers buying the bulbs had more than doubled, from five to 13 per cent.  Now other retailers stock various energy efficient bulbs at competitive prices. [1] View Wal-Mart sees jump in CFL sales"
supply chain transparency,"This captures the extent to which information about the companies, suppliers and sourcing locations is readily available to end-users and other companies in the supply chain.  Transparency has become increasingly important for supply chains, as consumers want to know the origin of products and services.  Organic foods and  conflict-free  diamonds are some of the items that require all supply chain partners to ensure traceability of goods. Non-governmental organisations are actively educating consumers on the production processes behind the goods they buy. For instance, there is much consumer interest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability leading to a demand for responsibly sourced tea and coffee. [1] Example  If you do not make information about your supply chain publicly available, the chances are increasing that consumers will do it for you. They are being aided by technologies such as GoodGuide, an online database of qualified information about the health, environmental and social impact of 65,000 common products. GoodGuide was founded in 2007 by Dara O Rourke, a professor of environmental and labour policy at the University of California, Berkeley. It uses a team of scientists and technologists to vet products in four categories: food, toys, personal care, and household products. Each of these products is rated and ranked on numerous criteria ranging from the harmfulness of its ingredients to its manufacturer s record on working conditions, diversity and reporting. The information is accessible via a website or an iPhone application, which can be used to scan the barcode of an item in the shop for instant feedback.

sustainability leaders,"People and organisations who are clear that climate change, loss of biodiversity, reductions in non-renewable fossil fuels, depletion of rare earth metals and other significant shifts are serious and urgent challenges to which human society needs to respond.  Some leading businesses are now keen for general rules of conduct to encourage pro-environmental behaviours, and seek to influence policy in field-shaping ways.  Often they are involved in cross-sector initiatives to integrate environmental, social and economic benefits. Courage and risk-taking are key components of sustainability leadership.  But so is taking care of oneself.  Burnt-out 'change agents' to society are not sustainable models.  People work at developing the crafts of doing this work well, including skills of communication. [1] Example Some examples of sustainability leaders include: people pioneering responsible policies and practices in their organisations and building appropriate coalitions, often across sectors.

sustainable development,"Sustainable development is about maintaining an equilibrium between human activity and the natural environment over the long term. It involves a fine balance between the economic, social and environmental needs and expectations of various stakeholders. Examples Sustainable development is a very broad concept that encompasses a number of diverse areas. The examples provided below are sustainable development think-tanks. The Natural Step s a not-for-profit organisation formed with the vision of creating a sustainable society. The purpose of Natural Step is to promote understanding and action towards sustainability. Among other things, the organisation has developed a framework to help gain an understanding of sustainable development for any type of organisations including companies. Another example is SustainAbility, founded in 1987 in the UK, its purpose is to provide solutions to make businesses and markets more sustainable. They work on a broad set of issues such as energy, climate and accountability. [1]"
sustainable enterprise,"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) emerged in the UK in the 1990s as a developing agenda which was a reflection of growing public and governmental concerns about the effects of large corporations on society and the environment. The chief areas of CSR focus have been a company s marketing practices and communications, and also the impact of their operations on workers in their supply chain including their families and communities. The CSR agenda is being replaced by the practices of sustainability. Such practices by corporations carries resonance with their stakeholders as well as their investors who see value creation opportunities and cost reduction opportunities in the strategic use of sustainability concepts, practices and innovation. However, investments in sustainability projects and innovation are frequently longer-term investments and economic returns on social and environmental investments may take up to three years or more. Sustainable business or sustainable enterprise are terms that are now being used by firms who are integrating sustainable business practices into their corporate and brand strategies whilst seeking to address both shareholder and stakeholder interests within these strategies. Examples Mike Barry, director of sustainable business at Marks & Spencer, the UK retailer, described their successful Plan A strategy launched in 2007 as a recognition that  the days of corporate social responsibility are over  and that CSR has been replaced by the larger and more strategic idea of sustainable business. The aim of Plan A is to make Marks & Spencer the world's most sustainable retailer.  The strategy involves 180 commitments to achieve by 2015.  the retailer is working with customers and suppliers to deal with climate change, cut waste, use sustainable raw materials, trade ethically, and help customers to adopt healthier lifestyles.

Sefs in the news In April 2013, Bloomberg, the financial news and information provider, filed a lawsuit against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in order to prevent exchanges gaining an edge in the battle over how derivatives will trade under new rules.

swing voter,"The best efforts to define Britain s swing voters have resorted to alliteration   from the Pebbledash People and Worcester Woman to Mondeo Man and now Motorway Man. Less memorable are the Asda Mums, Schoolgate Mums and Sierra Man of past years. These may be stereotypes but they contain more than a grain of socio-economic truth. At their heart are attempts by parties and pollsters to zero in on the floating voters whose attitudes can define the outcome of a general election. About 100 seats across Britain are vital to the Tories  attempt to gain a Commons majority. Inhabited by neither urban working class nor the rural wealthy, they straddle an English heartland dominated by white-collar, upwardly mobile professionals. [1]"

synthetic CDOs,"Synthetic collateralised debt obligations (synthetic CDOs) are pools of debt instruments which include credit default swaps as well as cash bonds. These instruments are used in a variety of trading strategies to hedge risk and to give investors exposure to the credit markets without having to buy the underlying assets.  Synthetic CDOs pool derivatives known as credit default swaps and then divide them into different pieces, or  tranches,  with varying levels of risk. The deals allow investors to make amplified, or leveraged, bets on the underlying loans or bonds. Banks sold $61bn worth of synthetic CDOs in 2006, at the height of the credit bubble, according to the commission set up by the US government to investigate the crisis. Synthetic CDOs became notorious as the 2008/2009 financial crisis unfolded when it became clear that their widespread use had exacerbated the financial crisis. Declines in the market value of the products had triggered contract clauses in senior tranches (which were leveraged, allowing investors to pay only a fraction of the senior tranche's total value, thereby making them attractive to those deterred by the low yields) that required investors to stump up billions of dollars of collateral or walk away.   synthetic CDOs in the news In June 2013 an FT report looked at an attempt by JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to relaunch synthetic CDOs. The deal would have included a range of tranches: a ""senior piece"" considered less risky than the ""mezzanine"", or middle, piece, and the lowest-ranking ""equity"" tranche. However, investors were reported to be uninterested in the senior, low interest, part of the deal. In December 2013 there was a report that the instruments were once again poised for a comeback, but this time with a tweaked structure. Citigroup was proposing a new synthetic CDO deal, which would be tied to a pool of investment-grade corporate credits. Instead of asking investors to put up more collateral if the market value of the underlying portfolio were to fall, investors would have to pay up only if actual losses on the portfolio exceeded 15 per cent.

synthetic biology,"Synthetic biology is being described as the next stage in genetic engineering of micro-organisms. Synthetic biology makes the transition from ""reading"" DNA, which reached its apotheosis in the Human Genome Project completed at the beginning of the 21st century, to the much harder job of ""writing"" genetic code. The first successful creation of synthetic life was announced in May 2010 when genomics pioneer Craig Venter and his team succeeded in making bacteria in their laboratory. The bacterium, which consisted of over 1m chemical letters was built in steps and the microbes that resulted after transplanting the genome into the host cell could be distinguished from naturally occurring microbes by ""watermark sequences"" of inert DNA that do not occur in nature. The new bacterium was called ""Synthia"" by the media.   synthetic biology in the news In July 2013,  60m of funding was announced for British scientists for research in synthetic biology. The UK will join the US, China, India and other countries in the synthetic yeast project, which aims to recreate the yeast genome, its entire genetic code, from scratch in the laboratory by 2017. "

system thinking,"System thinking provides business managers with a holistic and inclusive way of looking at the world outside. Most of the time, when we attempt to solve a problem we are tempted to split the problem into smaller pieces so we can fix small problems with the intent of solving the bigger one. This approach is called a reductionist approach.  In contrast, system thinking means looking for connections in the area where the problem manifested, but it also means taking into account distant issues that we think at first glance are not connected with our problem. System thinking also entails going deeper into the problem and looking for root causes instead of symptoms. A business manager using a system thinking approach focuses on a deep exploratory review of the causes that created the problem, and also looks for the links that truly caused the problem. System thinking means adhering to the view that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Addressing the parts and hoping to solve the problem often does not work. It does not work because we need to find the root causes of the problem and as they often seem unrelated they are hard to see. System thinking does not provide the answer to every question, neither is it a better system than any other system. System thinking does not, for example, usually provide a replicable scientific model to address the challenges of an organisation. However, the fact that it keeps in consideration the whole system instead of adopting a ""silo"" approach, means it helps to clearly identify the participants of the system and to study their interrelations. System thinking provides an opportunity to understand the system as a whole, and, even if no conclusive deduction can be made in forecasting long term behaviour for the system, it is encouraging to know that there is order in what appears to be chaos. System thinking models help us to understand a system s behaviour from other perspectives. In a business perspective, the context of any system is made up of people, or of groups of organisations. The parties forming the context interact among themselves in a self-organised (Self Adapting System) way or they can be organised in a hierarchical structure(Holland, 1988). A system can be composed of more systems. A system can be known as closed, if it has no connections with the external environment, or open, if interconnected with other systems outside it. For today s managers, who have to compete to achieve their business objectives, becoming a system thinker is very important. System thinking promotes innovative thinking, because the successful solution is often simple but not always visible close to where the problem is.[1]"
systematic internaliser,"The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid), launched in November 2007, is the European initiative to promote competition and enhance choice for investors across Europe.Mifid replaces rules in many markets that require trades to be executed at local exchanges. Instead, banks will be allowed to act as ""systematic internalisers"", matching customer orders internally rather than showing these to the market. Systematic internalisers (SIs), traditionally called market makers, are investment firms who could match  buy  and  sell  orders from clients in-house, provided that they conform to certain criteria.  Instead of sending orders to a central exchange such as the London Stock Exchange, banks can match them with other orders on its own book.  Examples of such firms are Credit Suisse and UBS.SIs are able compete directly with stock exchanges and automated dealing systems, but they have to make such dealings transparent.  They have to show a price before a trade is made. After a trade is made, they have to give information about the transaction, just like conventional trading exchanges.The rise in competition to local exchanges has also created quite a few 'Multilateral trading facilities' (MTFs - these allow parties to trade among themselves away from the exchanges), where trades can be directed to and which are taking market share away from some of the established exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange (LSE).

systems thinking,"Perhaps the most successful learning technique we are taught as we are growing up is the method of analysis by decomposition, in which we break complex things down to the level where we can understand the individual parts. This works for many things, but for dynamic systems, particularly those that involve humans, the usual effect is to squeeze out some of the most important features. Systems thinking is an approach that draws attention to connections among the parts, particularly focusing on how the elements of a system feed back to one another, both creating extraordinary patterns of growth (amplifying feedback) and providing ways to control the system (regulating feedback). ExampleWhen Fred Brooks was charged with managing the development of OS 360 (a computer operating system), a large initiative at IBM, he learned that as the project got behind schedule his bosses responded by providing him with additional programmers. They imagined that by increasing the number of programmers, more time would be spent on designing and programming so that more of the programme would be completed, eventually getting them back on schedule. In fig.1 below, known as a cause map, the arrows represent the effect of one factor (at the tail or an arrow) on another factor (at the arrow s head). A  +  sign means that when the first factor changes (say  Time behind schedule ) the second factor ( Number of programmers ) tends to change in the same direction. Fig. 1  Click here to view fig. 1 cause map That is, when you are behind schedule, management hires more programmers, when you are ahead of schedule, some of them may be laid off. When you are able to proceed from one factor, through others, back to the original factor, you have a cycle, known as a feedback loop. The four arrows in this diagram define such a feedback loop. There are two kinds of feedback, negative (regulating) and positive (amplifying). The former can be identified by an odd number of  - signs; the latter by an even number. The diagram above, with its odd number of minus signs, contains a regulating loop. Such a relationship among the parts brings the system into balance. It was anticipated that by adding programmers, the project would become stable again. It was only years later that Brooks understood why, rather than functioning as anticipated, added resources only made the situation worse. In fig. 2 below, the diagram  shows an amplifying loop that produced positive feedback (an even number of minus signs). Fig. 2  Click here to view larger version of the above fig. 2 cause map As new programmers were added, more time was required to bring them along. This, in turn, reduced the amount of time experienced programmers had to spend producing code. As they completed less of the program, the time behind schedule and the demand for more programmers grew, and still more time was consumed by education and communication. This dynamic is now known as Brook s Law:  Adding programmers to fix a delay, only makes it take longer.  [1]"

tail risk,"Tails are the end portions of distribution curves represented by bell-shaped graphs that show the statistical probability of  a measured event. The tails on the left and right of the bell shape represent the least likely outcomes. In investment terms bell curves can be used to plot investment outcomes. The lowest returns are represented on the left and the highest on the right. However, tails can be fatter than the normal distribution curve. A long term investor will want to minimise left tail risk without losing out on right tail growth potential. Investors can attempt to minimise tail risk (the risk of a fat tail) by tail risk hedging. They can limit the risk in their asset allocation by choosing sectors that are likely to be less volatile, or complement their long term strategy with derivative positions, for example. See below for a Pimco diagram illustrating tail risk to investors.                                                                                                                                                                                       tail risk in the news In March 2013 a special report on risk management in the FT looked at how hedge fund managers were coping with the additional risk of growing from one man bands into miniature institutions. Hedge funds' main task of providing insurance against tail risk could be complicated by having multiple teams of traders. It could mean that the same firm may actually be taking the same risk many times over."
takaful,"Islamic insurance. The philosophical foundation of takaful can be located in Islamic principles such as co-operation, responsibility, mutual protection within the framework of Islamic financial principles. Due to such principles, takaful is defined as a co-operative or mutual insurance, because members of a takaful company join in contributing a certain sum of money as their subscription to a common pool; losses are divided and liabilities spread. Takaful can be structured as either a mudaraba (profit-sharing) model, a wakala (agency agreement) model, or a combination of both.  The financing of takaful funds are subject to Sharia compliancy. In contrast to the developments in Islamic finance, the takaful industry has not shown similar developments, due to the slower take-up in insurance in the Muslim world. [1]"

taper worm,"Taper worm is a term borrowed from marathon runners who become anxious they will lose their fitness when they are advised to taper off their training in the week or so before the event to give their bodies a chance to recover before the big race.   taper worm in the news In May 2013 the term was being borrowed by the Barclays economic research team to apply to the nagging doubt that an economic slowdown could result from a tapering on quantitative easing (QE). An Alphaville blog post referred to a host of  canaries in the bond-mine  (mortgages, REITs, utility stocks, lumber), which were indicating that markets were getting nervous about QE tapering, and suggesting the next move in bond yields was more likely to be up than down."
tapering,"The word tapering in financial terms is increasingly being used to refer to the reduction of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing, or bond buying programme.   tapering in the news ""Taper talk"" started in June 2013 when speculation increased that the Fed would start on a tapered end to QE in 2014. The increase in bond yields had already inflicted heavy losses on bond investors. There were mixed opinions on whether tapering or suspending QE would be good for markets or not.  Global markets started experiencing a sell off after the Fed indicated that it expected to ease its asset purchases later this year. But by September 2013 the markets were thrown into fresh turmoil when Fed chairman Ben Bernanke seemed to back away from some of the guidance that the Fed gave in June. In December 2013, however, tapering talk turned to action. On the day of Ben Bernanke's last press conference as chairman of the Federal Reserve the Federal Open Market Committee finally decided it would scale down its $85bn-a-month asset purchase programme. Instead, US monetary authorities would reduce purchases by $10bn to each month so long as the US economy continued to to improve. Despite initial falls in the currencies of some emerging market nations, by the beginning of 2014 some observers, such as Templeton's Mark Mobius, said they believed the fear that tapering would affect emerging market investment was overblown.

target date funds or lifecycle funds,"Target date funds, or lifecycle funds are funds marketed for investors likely to retire in a particular year. The asset allocation is supposed to change gradually to safer asset classes as the investor approaches retirement. There is a distinction to be made between those funds which aim to disburse all the returns on the target date and those which expect to continue managing investment through retirement.  [1] The transition   from early allocations which are supposed to accumulate capital gains and later allocations which are supposed to protect them to deliver a lump sum or generate income on a specified date   is known as a glidepath. Investors can choose a fund with a target date nearest to when they will need to draw down capital or income. For example, a 30-year-old in 2010 planning to retire in 35 years time might have chosen a 2045 fund.   Target date funds in the news In July 2012 Goldman Sachs announced it was closing its line of US target-date funds, following two other groups who had also exited the target-date funds space.

tawarruq,"A tawarruq is an Islamic financial product which allows clients to raise money quickly and easily, in theory without breaking Muslim bans on interest. A customer buys an easily saleable asset from an Islamic bank at a marked up price, to be paid at a later date, and quickly sells the asset to raise cash. Tawarruq means ""turns into silver"". For example, a customer might buy $1,000 worth of non-precious metal from a bank, to be paid in 12 months' time, and then immediately sells the metal back to the bank for $900 to be paid immediately. Effectively the customer will have borrowed $900 for a year at an interest rate of 11 per cent, meanwhile satisfying the Islamic requirement for tangible assets to underlie all transactions. Sharia scholars, who have to approve all Islamic financial products and services, have had much discussion about tawarruqs because of their similarity to interest-bearing loans.  They began to question the instrument more closely when they noticed the billions of dollars of commodity-based tawarruq transactions, which did not match with an equivalent amount of the commodity being traded.   tawarruq in the news In April 2009, the International Islamic Fiqh Academy, a prestigious body of Muslim clerics tied to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, ruled that ""organised use"" of the tawarruq financial instrument was prohibited. The move was a blow to Islamic banks which were relying on the instrument both for lending and for liquidity management. In November 2013, however, the UK was attempting to resurrect plans to market the western world's first Islamic government bond and was hoping to avoid the fate of Goldman Sachs whose attempt two years previously was dogged by religious controversy and eventually foundered because its use of tawarruq was criticised.  The Goldman Sachs sukuk structure was controversial,  Mohammed Daud Bakar, a prominent Malaysian sharia scholar and president of Amanie Advisors was quoted as saying.  Investors will want to see what the legal structure of the UK sukuk will be. "

tax avoidance,"Tax avoidance is a practice of using legal means to pay the least amount of tax possible. This is different to tax evasion which is the practice of using illegal methods to avoid paying tax.   There is also a difference between avoidance and tax planning as paying minimal tax is not necessarily a sign of avoidance. Tax avoidance is using the tax law to obtain a tax advantage that the government never intended. It frequently involves contrived, artificial transactions that serve no purpose other than to reduce tax liability. Tax planning involves using tax reliefs for the purpose for which they were intended. Also see tax haven and tax shelter.   tax avoidance in the news In 2013, a plan to tackle multinationals  tax avoidance was drawn up by the G20 in the wake of a firestorm of public anger   particularly in Europe and Australia   over the low tax bills paid by certain companies. It was argued that existing principles had been designed decades ago in an era before tax havens and the digital economy. Increasingly, globalisation placed a strain on the system, not least because of the ease with which multinationals have centralised their intangible assets   the intellectual property, brands, trademarks and knowhow that now make up 80 per cent of their value   in low tax countries.Governments   with differing degrees of enthusiasm   agreed that the system needs reform and the status quo is not an option.Internet companies also became the poster children of aggressive tax avoidance. The OECD set up a dedicated task force to look at their business models and examine the question of how companies can have a significant digital presence in a country without being liable to taxation. In 2014, plans to  restore taxation  in the countries where digital companies make their sales and base their headquarters were set out by the OECD in the first international response to the worldwide political row over the sector s low tax payments. Campaign groups and charities also voiced support for extending taxing rights so that countries would be able to tax companies even when these businesses have no people or buildings in a country   provided they have a website or gather data there. But business groups voiced strong opposition to the idea, saying it would cause significant complexity and uncertainty. [1] In April 2014 an FT story described how US companies were using a practice known as inversion   by moving their headquarters overseas they have been able to slash their tax rate. See graphic: "
tax base,"The aggregate value of the financial streams or assets on which tax can be imposed. In the case of income tax, for instance, the tax base is determined by what the tax authorities state as the minimum amount of annual income that can be taxed (taxable income).

tax inversion,"A transaction used by a company whereby it becomes a subsidiary of a new parent company in another country for the purpose of falling under beneficial tax laws. Typically they are used by US companies to move to lower tax domiciles, in Europe in particular. Tax inversions can take different forms. For example, take the case of a cosmetics company called Helen of Troy in 1993. Incorporated in the US, it created a shell company in the tax haven of Bermuda, and made it the parent company of the US business.However, following the deal, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) clamped down on such transactions where they could be shown to have been carried out purely to avoid US taxes. It issued the first rules against inversion in 1996.In 1960, the US was home to 17 of the world s 20 largest companies. Fifty years later, only six were headquartered there.Such inversions have come at a time when politicians in Washington have been increasing their calls for corporate tax reform.Tax rules in the US have been tightened. Until 2003, a US company could simply create a new foreign headquarters to which the US group became a subsidiary. A rush of such deals in the early 2000s drew the attention of Congress.   tax inversion in the news US advertising company Omnicom has said its $35bn merger with Publicis will result in the combined group s headquarters being located in the Netherlands, saving about $80m in US tax a year. Meanwhile, Liberty Global s $23bn acquisition of Virgin Media will allow the US cable group to relocate to the UK, and pay its lower 21 per cent tax rate of corporation tax.Many US acquirers of European companies have not disclosed their exact tax savings.

tax shield,"A tax shield is the present value of future tax savings attributed to the tax deductibility of a particular expense in a company's P&L.; Usually the term in used in connection to interest on corporate debt ( tax shield of debt ). Interest expense is, as opposed to dividends and capital gains, tax deductable, therefore the tax shield (being a benefit of debt financing over equity financing) is an important factor influencing the company's capital structure choice. While academic research in general agrees on the importance of taxes for capital structure decisions, there is still a wide range of estimates of the magnitude of the tax shield. Empirical estimates for its value vary between 5 per cent and 15 per cent of corporate outstanding debt. Research has identified besides the level of debt, the tax rate, credit risk, bankruptcy probability and the firm s future financing policy (i.e. adapting future debt levels to changing economic conditions) as important variables influencing the value of the tax shield.    tax shields in the news Some governments are concerned about the ""excessive use"" of corporate debt by certain investors, especially private equity investors. One potential strategy to influence corporate capital structure choices is to cut the tax deductibility of interest. By doing so tax authorities reduce the tax shield and remove a significant benefit of debt financing over equity financing. In 2008 the German government introduced a regulation to limit the recognition of interest as tax deductable expense to 30 per cent of the firm s current EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation). In the current discussion on corporate tax regulations in the US this idea plays an important role as well. However, while obviously aiming towards incentivising PE investors to use less debt, it remains unclear whether this limitation will have a positive or negative effect upon private equity deal performance.

tech bubble,"The tech bubble was created by investors who believed that anything to do with the the Net would turn to gold. Nearly any dotcom business was able to gain funding and go public. In perhaps the most poignant sign of overreach, internet service provider AOL (America Online) bought Time Warner in 2000, in what is regarded as the worst deal in history. [1] Long before the housing bubble, sustained low interest rates and global financial imbalances had already created the conditions for excess. The promise of the internet provided the perfect excuse, drawing in tech visionaries and financial opportunists alike. The 1994 launch of the Netscape browser opened the online medium to a mass audience and triggered a gold rush. Add in the boom in corporate technology spending later in the decade to deal with the Y2K computing problem   also known as the  Millennium bug    and the full forces of fear and greed were unleashed. The winners were the internet companies that sold at the peak of the boom or   like AOL   used their inflated currency to buy more enduring assets.

Via purposefully designed governance mechanisms, technology ecosystems can promote contributions of autonomous actors to create complementary products and services to address the needs of a large, globally heterogenous group of end-users in a manner that would be prohibitively difficult for the platform core to do alone. Technology ecosystem governance can also limit the inferior quality complementary products or destructive business practices of poor performing complementary product providers.[1]"

the bullwhip effect,"The bullwhip effect refers to a frustrating phenomenon that frequently starts with falling customer demand (lthough it could start with the reverse...a previously unanticipated rapid rise in customer demand). This fall in customer demand prompts retailers to under-order so as to reduce their inventories. In turn, wholeasers under-order even further to reduce theirs and the effect amplifies up the supply chain until suppliers experience stock-outs and then over-order in response. The effect can ripple up and down the supply chain many times. The effect is amplified as it moves up the supply chain and further away from the customer.   bullwhip effect in the news Producers of almost everything were left stranded when the global downturn took hold and retailers ran down inventories. On the way back up, the restocking of goods was so dramatic that most economists excluded the effect from their analysis. An FT Lex report in July 2011 observed that the whip might be cracking on the downside. Following a peak in February 2011, the European Purchasing Managers Index had fallen to about 50, the largest swing in a decade. The US saw a similar fall indicating that companies restocked too much and were now aggressively destocking."

the internet of things,"Currently, the internet is a network of computers each with an identifying label consisting of an unique number called an IP address. The vision of the internet of things is to attach tiny devices to every single object to make it identifiable by its own unique IP address. These devices can then autonomously communicate with one another. The success of the internet of things relies on overcoming the following technical challenges:  The current manner of using IP addresses must change to a system that provides an IP address to every possible object that may need one in the future. The power behind the embedded chips on such devices will need to be smaller and more efficient. The software applications must be developed that can communicate with and manage the stream of data from hundreds of interconnected non-computing devices that comprise a 'smart' system which can adapt and respond to changes.  Example With the implementation of such devices on every object, a medicine cabinet may be continuously aware of the status of each medicine bottle stored inside the cabinet such as its name, contraindications and expiry date. Also, engineers may be able to query each cable in a suspension bridge to determine the extent of fatigue wear.

the other side of innovation,"The other side of innovation refers to how to execute an innovative idea. Companies think far too little about the other side of innovation.  As such, they have more ideas than they can possibly deal with. Companies cannot survive without innovating. But, most put far more emphasis on generating big ideas than executing them - turning big ideas into actual breakthrough products, services, and process improvements. That is because generating ideas is energising and glamorous.  By contrast, execution seems to be viewed as behind-the-scenes dirty work.  But without execution, big ideas go nowhere. Companies that have done a good job in executing innovation initiatives include IBM, Thomson Reuters, Infosys and Deere. [1]"

three box strategic thinking,"Strategy used to be about protecting existing competitive advantage. In a fast changing world, it is about finding the next advantage.  In fact, strategy starts to decay the day it is created.  The three box thinking is a way of developing strategies.  Actions that companies take belong in one of three boxes:    Box 1 - managing the present  Box 2 - selectively abandoning the past  Box 3 - creating the future Box 1 is about improving current businesses; Box 2 and 3 are about innovation, breakout performance (big changes), and growth. Many organisations restrict their strategic thinking to Box 1, as leaders emphasise cost reduction and margin improvements (smaller changes) in their current businesses.  But strategy cannot be just about what an organisation needs to do to secure profits in the short term.  Strategy must include Boxes 2 and 3.  It must be about what a company needs to do to sustain leadership in the long term. ExampleApple created the personal computer industry in the late 1970s and enjoyed record-setting sales. However, as their PC business started to slow down, Apple built a new growth platform by transforming the music-recording industry through a radical business model: mass customisation of music in a cool, attractive product: the iPod. After introducing the first model, Apple regenerated the product by maintaining balanced efforts across Boxes 1, 2, and 3. The iPod moved through several generations during 2000-2006 (Nano, Video iPod), each new product destroying the old model but allowing Apple to remain in the lead. Apple then went on to revolutionalise the telecommunication industry with the iPhone in 2006 which has gone through many improvements. Apple introduced the iPad in 2010 to transform the Netbook field. The results are instructive.  Apple s sales were about $12 billion in 1995. Over the next six years, the company s sales gradually declined, leveling to about $5 billion in 2001, when it introduced the iPod. As of 2010, Apple s sales are about $45 billion, thanks to the Box 2 and Box 3 initiatives. [1]"

too big to fail,"This term is most often used to denote banks and firms that would substantially damage the financial system and the rest of the economy should they  fail , i.e., go bankrupt. The logic is therefore that these organisations would receive a  bailout  of some kind from the government - at the very least, protecting creditors against losses and perhaps also enabling management to stay in place (and, in some cases, the full payment of wages and bonuses). The term has been used in the United States since at least the 1980s, when it arose in the context of the conservatorship extended to Continental Illinois.The definitive book on the history and analytics of the topic is ""Too Big To Fail"", by Gary Stern and Ron Feldman (Brookings Institution Press), written in the early 2000s.  Andrew Ross Sorkin s more recent book with the same title provides a blow-by-blow account of how big US banks were rescued in fall 2008 after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.The Dodd-Frank legislation of 2010 was argued, by its proponents, to have  ended too big to fail , for example, by extending FDIC-style resolution to all financial institutions - even the largest and most dangerous.

total dividend,The sum of a company's interim dividend and final dividend for any particular year.
total expense ratio,"The Total Expense Ratio (TER) provides investors with a clearer picture of the total annual costs involved in running an investment fund.  The TER consists principally of the manager's annual charge, but also includes the costs for other services paid for by the fund, such as the fees paid to the trustee (or depositary), custodian, auditors and registrar.  Collectively, these fees are known as the ""additional costs"".TERs on actively managed funds are typically between 1 per cent and 2 per cent, while tracker funds charge 0.5 per cent or less.  It is likely that large funds will have lower TERs than small funds, that funds investing in overseas markets have higher TERs than UK funds and that new funds will show higher costs than old funds.  However, the principal difference in TERs is whether the fund manager has a higher or lower annual charge. [1] As it sounds, this is a measure of what a fund costs to run. Typically it includes the annual management charge, plus other charges incurred in running the fund. These can include share registration fees, legal fees, custodian fees etc. Trading costs are not included.  [2]ViewVanguard launches bargain UK tracker range "
total output,See aggregate supply
total outsourcing,"Total outsourcing can be defined as outsourcing an entire activity to a supplier. Example In the case of information technology (IT), for instance, total outsourcing means outsourcing all IT activities to a supplier. These activities include managing data centres, micro-computers, telecommunications networks, applications development, applications maintenance, systems design and integration. Total outsourcing has three main advantages. First, there is cash generation for the client when the supplier buys the assets. Second, dealing with a single vendor - as is often the case with total outsourcing - entails lower vendor management costs. Third, it generally leads to larger economies of scale than selective outsourcing because of the sheer size of the contract. Total outsourcing also has major disadvantages. When specific activities are outsourced, vendors may standardise these to the extent that the unique needs of the client are no longer met.  A classic example is that of IT applications. When the supplier standardises these, it reaps economies of scale. However, the benefits are lower for the client because the applications are no longer tailored to their needs. When activities are homogeneous, they may either be totally outsourced or not outsourced at all. Outsourcing specific activities is also dangerous because it creates a dependence situation as companies that outsource an entire activity no longer have a sufficient level of expertise in-house to control or manage their supplier.

total return,"Total return is the full return on an investment over a given period, including the income generated from dividend, interest or rental payments, and any gains or losses from a change in the asset's market value. This is normally expressed as a percentage of the purchase cost, annualised if the period is less than a year.   total return in the news In March 2014 the FT commented on the differing dividend policies of UK housebuilders which generated different total returns for investors. An investor in upmarket building firm Berkeley wuold have seen shares rise by 145 per cent over a decade but would have enjoyed total returns of 500 per cent. This compares to the sector as a whole which has seen share prices rise by 45 per cent and total returns by 78 per cent."
total return fund,"A total return fund is one that seeks to maximise gains from both income generatiing investments, such as bonds and dividend paying stocks, while simultaneously aiming to invest in assets which will experience capital appreciation. Investors's income gains in these funds are usually reinvested in the fund. Their final returns are the total generated by both the income and the capital appreciation of the assets the fund invests in.   total return fund in the news In April 2014 Pimco's legendary Total Return Fund managed by Bill Gross was beaten by 94 per cent of its rivals. Pimco said in its defence that the fund had outperformed its benchmark index for the past six months and the past two, five and 10 years making it the fifth-best ranked mutual fund in its category. But outflows by the end of March 2014 from the world's largest fixed income fund reached $52.1bn since April 2013."
total shareholder return,"This refers to capital accumulation. It is based on the value created for an investor who holds shares in a particular company and reinvests the dividends in the stock. In reality, returns tend to be lower because it is a rare shareholder who reinvests all dividend payouts and does not sell any shares. [1]"

total tax,"Total tax is a measure of all taxes borne and collected by a company. Whilst corporate income tax is the tax that is most often visible in the public disclosures that a company is required to make, it is however one of a large number of taxes that a company has to either pay to, or collect on behalf of, a tax authority (e.g. HMRC). [1]"
touch,"A company s share price spread, or touch, is the smallest available difference between its bid and offer prices. A small company that doesn t have many shares in issue and its trading volumes are small will almost certainly have a wide spread. The wide spread gives the market makers flexibility when they want to secure shares. Although it does mean that the price obtained for the shares may not necessarily be as high as the seller would want or it could be higher than the buyer anticipated. On the other hand a large company whose shares are traded in volumes of 5 million per day will have a narrow spread and the market makers will have little trouble fulfilling an order at a predictable price.The shares of the largest companies are traded by brokers using the SETS  order book system  and the prices of the companies traded by this method are even more predictable.  [1]"
toxic assets,"Financial assets the value of which has fallen significantly and may fall further, especially as the market for them has frozen. This may be due to hidden risks within the assets becoming visible or due to changes in the external market environment, or both.Many of banks' problems in the financial crisis were due to such toxic assets, such as securitisations of subprime mortgages, where the original creators of the securities failed to take into account the real rate of mortgage default and the extent to which it would be contagious across securities. Assets that were rated AAA and worth a lot suddenly looked  like junk bonds and were worth a fraction of their previous value, if indeed it was possible to find a price at all in a market where no one wanted to buy them.

The stock is sometimes also called alphabet stock because its designation and stock symbol are typically derived by adding a letter to the end of the parent's name and symbol."

trading book,"For regulatory purposes, banks divide their activities in two main categories: banking and trading, whereby banks' assets either belong to the banking book or to the trading book (though sometimes they are switched from one place to the other). Banking book assets and trading book assets can have very different regulatory treatment, even if the nature of the asset turns out to be exactly the same. The trading book was devised to house market-related assets (derivatives, bonds and so on) rather than traditional banking activities. Trading book assets are supposed to be highly liquid and easy to trade. As banks significantly began to grow their market activities since the early 1990s, the trading book became bigger. Regulators decided to let banks use Value at Risk models to calculate capital charges for the trading book. Given how low VaR can be, and given how much banks can love leverage, this gave institutions an incentive to park as many assets as possible in the trading - rather than banking - book. In the run-up to the 2008 credit crisis, many banks had placed a lot of assets that looked of a banking book-type into the trading book, possibly to take advantage of lower capital requirements. So the big story of the crisis became how banks had accumulated all those billions of subprime CDO tranches (whose eventual meltdown killed the banks) in their trading books. After the crash, regulators recognised that they had been very lax when it came to policing the trading book, permitting banks to abuse it with undesirable results. A thorough review of the trading book is currently taking place, with regulators eagerly trying to avoid future repeats of such pernicious regulatory arbitrage. [1]"

trailing stop,"Also called trailing stop order, this is a share trading tool that offers a way to lock in profits in volatile markets. This type of stop loss moves with the market. So if, for example, a currency was moving up on a buy bet, the stop-loss would also move up. If the currency then fell back, the stop-loss would close the bet before it returned to the initial trade price, ensuring the trader still made a profit. With a traditional stop-loss, shares are sold if they fall to a fixed level. With a trailing stop, this trigger price ratchets up if the shares rise. Shares are then automatically sold if the price falls back from its high by the specified margin - say, 5 per cent. So, if a share spikes up but then reverses, investors can get out with much of their initial profit still intact. If instead the price keeps rising, they stay invested. Stop-loss and limit orders are useful for locking in to prices without having to continually monitor markets. Such orders can be neat ways of taking advantage of short-term volatility, say to pick up shares at a lower price or sell at a higher price. But at times of high volatility, a fixed stop-loss, for example, can quickly lose touch with market prices and therefore offer less protection. A trailing stop makes it easier for investors to capture upward momentum and protect profits. [1] ExampleTrailing stops can be useful in volatile markets. These automatically track the underlying price higher over the duration of the bet. If the market is rising in favour of the bet they will also rise, helping to lock in profits should it reverse. For example, with the FTSE at 5,000, a stop could be placed at 4,750. If a trade is made at  1 a point without a stop and the index rises to 5,300, then falls back to 4,750, the customer would walk away with a  250 loss. However, if a trailing stop is used, the price at which the position will be closed out will move up with the underlying market price. In this case, the stop could trail 250 points below market price and step up in 50-point increments. So, when the market is at 5,000, the stop would be at 4,750. If the market rises to 5,050, the stop would rise to 4,800 and if it rises to 5,300, the stop would hit 5,050. If at this stage the market fell back to 5,000, the stop would be triggered at 5,050 and the better would have made a  50 profit.

transaction cost analysis,"A method of determining the effectiveness of a company s portfolio transactions. Transaction cost analysis (TCA) is essentially a rating of the spread between two possible prices   and the difference between those prices is often called  slippage.  The first number is the price of a particular transaction if it were executed at the prevailing price at the time the portfolio manager decided to buy or sell. The second is the actual price of the transaction, including commissions, taxes and other costs. [1] Transaction cost analysis (TCA) is the study of trade prices to determine whether the trades were arranged at favourable prices - low prices for purchases and high prices for sales.  Investment managers, brokers, and exchanges all analyse transactions to determine whether their trading procedures are producing the best possible results.  Investment sponsors also use TCA to determine whether their managers are trading effectively.  Results from these analyses are often used to fine tune trading processes to make them more effective. The main challenge of TCA is to determine whether a trade price is high or low given market conditions at the time the order was processed.  For this purpose, trade prices are commonly compared to benchmark prices such as the volume-weighted average trade price of the day (VWAP analyses) or the midpoint of the bid/ ask spread at the time the order was first created (implementation shortfall analyses).  Purchases with prices that are high relative to these benchmarks are considered expensive trades as are sales at prices below benchmark prices.   ExampleTransaction cost analyses sometimes also consider the opportunity costs associated with trades that are not completed.  The failure to trade can be very detrimental to portfolio performance if the trade turned out to be very profitable had it been completed. [2]"

Normally refers to government payments such as unemployment benefits and state pensions, although the term can also theoretically be applied to some private sector payments, such as contributions to charities."
transfer price,"The price paid for goods and services supplied by one part of a large company to another. If it is able to, a group will try to set such prices at levels that minimise its overall tax liability (for instance, pricing a service as low as possible when the supplying unit is in a high-tax country). [1] ExampleAuthorities have increasingly focused on the complex issue of transfer pricing, which allows companies to reduce their tax liabilities by transferring intangible property   such as patents, trademarks and licences   to subsidiaries, which are often in offshore, lower tax countries. Measures adopted including the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) blacklisting tax havens. GlaxoSmithKline, the UK pharmaceuticals maker, has been involved in a long-running dispute with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over a $864m claim. In November 2009, the IRS conceded a claim for the years to 2001-2003 over penalties although the two parties are in the process of settling tax issues for the period and subsequent years. The transfer pricing market is thought to be worth about $15.5bn annually but has become contentious as more countries introduce regulations and cash-strapped governments intensify efforts to ensure they receive an adequate share of revenues.

transfer pricing,"On a broad level, this requires businesses to apply arm s length prices to transactions between connected companies, or to make adjustments to accounting profits to reflect arm s length pricing for tax purposes. It also aims to prevent groups or connected parties from reducing their taxable profits with non-arm s length funding arrangements (such as a high level of debt to equity or an excessive interest rate) so that non-arm s length interest payments between connected parties are not deductible in the computation of taxable profits. These rules are very wide and not only apply to transactions between UK and overseas companies but also apply between UK companies. Small and medium sized groups are generally exempted from the UK s transfer pricing regime.  [1]"

transformational leadership,"An approach to leadership that moves followers to transcend self-interest for the good of the organisation. Transformational leadership consists of six behaviours: articulating a vision; setting a positive example; communicating high performance expectations; showing sensitivity to individual followers  needs; encouraging a team attitude; and providing intellectual stimulation. Research shows that groups led by transformational leaders boast higher levels of performance than groups led by other types of leaders. Transformational leaders' high expectations give their subordinates the self-confidence to persist in the face of setbacks, often resulting in exceptional performance. Example Executives who are often described as transformational leaders include Richard Branson of the Virgin Group. Branson pays attention to his followers  individual concerns about the company, expresses confidence in his employees' abilities to perform at a very high level, and puts forth a mission that is clear and engaging to members of the Virgin community.[1]"

treasury auctions,"Treasury auctions are the most common selling mechanism for sovereign debt in many countries. When submitting a bid to participate in an auction, investors have to indicate the amount that they want to buy as well as the price that they want to pay for it.  The sellers around the world mainly use two basic auction formats to determine the amount to allocate to each bidder and the price the bidder has to pay.  These are discriminatory-price auctions in which bidders have to pay the price they bid for, and uniform-price auctions in which each bidders pays the same price. ExampleThe United States used discriminatory price auctions until the 1990s and then switched to a uniform-price auction format to sell its Treasury securities. Other countries such as Germany have traditionally used a discriminatory-price auction format. Furthermore, selling mechanisms differ across countries by the discretion the seller keeps after observing the actual demand, e.g. by varying the supply and not allocating the whole announced issue volume to investors.

triparty repo,"In a repurchase, or ""repo"", transaction, an investor can borrow cash for a short period from another party, using securities as collateral for the loan. Investors with large portfolios of securities can thus lend these out and earn a return over time.      At the centre of the US repo market sits the triparty model, where a custodian bank, Bank of New York Mellon and JPMorgan, helps to administer a repo agreement between two parties. An investor places its money with the custodian bank, which in turn lends it to another institution, and then assets are pledged as collateral for the loan.  [1]"

Earlier in October 2013, the Troika rejected Portugal's plea to relax deficit targets. In April 2013, Ireland lifted a legal ban on house repossessions, a move that was sought by the Troika. However, also in April 2013, an FT columnist warned that the IMF had lost its role as a neutral player after being dragged into the eurozone crisis as a junior partner."

two-part pricing,"Pricing strategy comprising a fixed (lump-sum) charge that does not vary with usage or consumption and an additional charge that does vary with usage or consumption. Providers of services including banking and finance, telecommunications and transport commonly apply two-part pricing.  One reason to set a two-part price is to cover some customer-specific fixed cost, such as the cost of connection in telecommunications or the cost of line rental. Example For instance, in February 2011, Singapore Telecom s rate for a residential fixed line was S$29.43 for three months plus a usage charge of 0.86 to 1.72 cents per 60 seconds, depending on the time of day. Another reason to use two-part pricing is to apply indirect price discrimination between customers with different demands for an item or service. For example, in the UK, you can apply for a BT (British Telecom) unlimited evening and weekend 12-month renewable phone contract at an additional cost.  Here, you get unlimited calls for up to an hour to UK landlines between 7pm and 7am weekdays and throughout the weekend. [1]"
two-sided markets,"A two-sided market is a meeting place for two sets of agents who interact through an intermediary or platform. Getting both sides on board is fundamental for the development and success of each platform and to our understanding of the pricing strategies followed by market participants. In considering the platform pricing strategies, the economics literature has demonstrated that the characteristic that distinguishes two-sided markets is that the pricing structure (the relative prices charged to each side), matters. The fact that two-sided markets are based on externalities, such as group or network externalities, and that the structure of prices matters, as much as their level, has important consequences for regulation. First, we should not expect to find a direct relationship between the price charged on one side and the incremental cost of serving that side. The prices that maximize consumer welfare will in fact often depart from the cost-reflective ones. Second, any change imposed to the price on one side will also change the price on the other side of the platform, thus creating a waterbed effect. Example A mall is a two-sided market in that consumers can find their favorite shops; credit cards are two-sided markets composed of cardholders and merchants; a newspaper is a two-sided market in that it brings together advertisers and readers; A mobile phone network is a two-sided market because it helps people who want to receive calls get together with people who want to make those calls. As a consumer I want to go to the mall that has the  right  shops or the wider variety of brands, I will use the credit card that most retailers accept, I will buy the operating system with the best applications, or I will subscribe to the mobile network with the largest customer base. There are many platforms in which one side pays nothing, or even receives inducements, to participate: shoppers in a mall, application developers, some credit card customers, free newspapers. More generally, each platform provider will try to balance prices in order to encourage take-up on both sides, which means that the prices charged to each side are jointly determined. [1]"

unauthorised fund,"An unauthorised fund, sometimes also referred to as an unregulated fund, is one that is not regulated or authorised by the local regulator, although the fund manager itself will often be authorised and governed by regulations. Common unregulated fund structures include unauthorised unit trusts, limited partnerships (as used by private equity fund managers) and investment trusts.   unauthorised fund in the news In December 2012 a study by law firm Allen & Overy found that although unregulated or lightly regulated funds were one of the most promising alternatives to bank lending, their ability to step in could soon face restraints due to new rules that would combine to make credit more expensive. Likewise in January 2013 it was reported that private equity and hedge fund managers in Europe would struggle to meet new requirements for unregulated funds, including having to find a depositary for the fund."

uncovered option,See naked option
uncovered parity,"A theory that relates current interest rates in two countries to the future value of the exchange rate for the currencies of those countries. The theory is built on the assumption that interest rates reflect expectations of inflation while changes in exchange rates reflect realised inflation.  Example Suppose the three month US Treasury bill rate is 3 per cent and the Canada Treasury bill rate is 2 per cent. If the assumptions underlying the theory are true, we interpret the difference between US and Canadian rates (1 per cent) as the market s estimate that over the next three months US inflation will exceed Canadian inflation by 1 per cent. Furthermore, the theory predicts that the number of US dollars needed to buy a Canadian dollar will be 1 per cent greater in three months, given that the US dollar is expected to lose 1 per cent more of its domestic purchasing power than the Canadian dollar. Some currency traders believe that uncovered parity does not hold and, therefore, there is a trading opportunity: borrow Canadian dollars at 2 per cent, change them to US dollars, deposit those US dollars at 3 per cent, and, three months later, the US dollar is higher and the Canadian dollar loan can be paid back with money to spare - an arbitrage profit (see carry trade). This strategy can indeed sometimes profit when the money and currency markets violate uncovered parity. However, the returns are very uncertain and some investors and academics believe any earnings are compensation for bearing risk rather than a true arbitrage profit. [1]"

underlying basis,"A measure of ""underlying"" profits or sales tends to strip out items that distort a company's trading performance, such as exchange ratemovements or acquisition costs. It can be a more helpful metric for investors than pre-tax profits or top-line sales. However, there is no formal, universally recognised, definition, which means companies can choose what items to include and exclude. Investors should therefore be aware that companies can use the measure to present themselves in a favourable light. It can also make comparisons, both across time for an individual company or between companies, rather hazardous. [1]"

underwrite,"To guarantee against financial risk by assuming that risk, as financial institutions do when they offer (underwrite) an insurance policy, or when they buy a new securities issue from the issuer for re-sale to the public. A new securities issue is normally underwritten by a group of investment banks (called the underwriting group or syndicate). One bank, appointed by the group as lead manager, signs the underwriting agreement that specifies all the details of the issuer-underwriter relationship (including pricing), and handles other arrangements including distribution of the issue through dealers or other investment banks (the selling group). The fee the underwriter earns is the spread (the underwriting spread) between the price it pays the issuer for the stock, and the price at which it re-sells the stock to the public (the issue or public offering price), either directly or through dealers."

unitranche,"A unitranche is a type of credit facility or loan that is becoming increasingly popular in circumstances where borrowers would otherwise have had to separately negotiate first lien and second lien loans (guaranteed by assets and demanding different interest rate repayments) or senior and mezzanine credit facilities. Unitranches are provided under a single set of loan documents administered by one agent for the lenders. Lenders separately agree among themselves ""first out"" and ""last out"" tranches which include provisions in the event of a default. The credit agreement in a unitranche usually provides one blended pricing to the borrower, however, which falls between the rate charged by the first-out lender and the last-out lender. Significantly, unlike in first and second lien, or senior/mezzanine debt credit facilities, the borrower makes only one agreement which could put question marks over borrowers' obligations to individual lenders in the event of bankruptcy.   unitranche in the news In January 2014, it was announced that Barclays had joined forces with BlueBay Asset Management to offer unitranche debt to UK companies. While the borrower would see one loan and one rate, it was revealed that Barclays would be reimbursed first if the company became insolvent and that BlueBay would fund the riskier part of the loan but get a bigger share of the profit."

Example The observation that unsolicited ratings are often lowly graded has led to the accusation that agencies use this instrument to blackmail borrowers into soliciting (and paying for) a rating assessment. Research has shown, however, that low-quality issuers are less willing to pay for a credit rating, receiving instead unsolicited ratings that are low-graded. [1]"

user,Someone or something that uses a product or service. [1] 
user innovation,"User innovation refers to new product and service development by individual users or individual user firms for themselves, without the assistance or involvement of producers. Innovation by individual users is perhaps the most important change in the innovation process since the Industrial Revolution. This approach offers great advantages over the producer-centered innovation development systems that have been the mainstay of commerce for hundreds of years. Notably, when users can innovate for themselves, they can develop exactly what they want, rather than having to rely on manufacturers to act as their (often very imperfect) agents. Recent research in the UK shows that 2.9 million ordinary consumers - 6.2% of the UK population - innovate to serve their personal new product needs.  Their collective expenditure - money for hours spent, charged at the average UK wage rate, plus cost of project materials -  is more than double that of all firm investments in the development of consumer goods. In other words, user innovation is a very important element of total innovation activity in the UK and other advanced economies. Example Scientists develop new scientific instruments for themselves, so they can measure exactly what they need to measure.  Producers then copy these user innovations - improved for manufacturability and reliability - and sell them to others. Sports enthusiasts develop new sports, everything from skateboarding to mountain biking to kitesurfing, and also develop the new equipment needed for these sports.  Producers then copy the user-developed products and sell them to the mass market. Firms from Intel to Ford need and use process equipment to manufacture products for sale.  They typically develop what they need for themselves.  They then transfer what they have developed to process equipment producers to make copies for them, and for the market.

user-generated content (UGC),"UGC refers to content generated by users on social media platforms on the internet.  Over the past few years we have seen the emergence of an internet-enabled capability that has now become ubiquitous in some markets and industries   that of allowing users to generate content about their product experiences, their transaction experiences and their purchase intent   that is available to other users. The increasing democratisation of online content creation is changing the nature of interaction between consumers and companies, whose strategies are shifting from influencing consumers directly to mediating the influence consumers have on each other. Under this new paradigm defined by the growing reliance on user-generated content, consumers' choices and opinions become more transparent while their views, decisions and interests shape the behaviour of other consumers. Much of this content, both structured and unstructured, has an economic value that can be quantified. This significantly expands the nature of consumer intelligence available to firms. Examples include product reviews, blogs, wikis, microblogs, content on social networking sites as well as multi-media content such as photos, graphics, videos, and podcasts. Example User-generated product reviews of electronics products (smart phones, plasma televisions, laptops, etc) have enabled consumers to provide feedback on the design and functionality of these products, which in turn has been taken into account by manufacturers to change their design in future product releases.[1]"

value at risk - VaR,"A risk management model that calculates the largest possible loss that an institution or other investor could incur on a portfolio. Value at risk describes the probability of losing more than a given amount of assets, based on a current portfolio. It was developed (not originated) at JPMorgan in response to a demand from then chairman Dennis Weatherstone to be told at 4.15pm every day what the overall risk position of the bank was. He was concerned the various trading desks and business units might be taking correlated bets without knowing about it. Without having time to check each trader s position individually, he wanted a way to understand the overall position. This has a couple of important implications: one, that it is a snapshot, a picture of what the risk level is now, based on what you hold now. The longer the time period you apply it to, the fuzzier it is likely to become. Two, it is a lower bound for loss, not an upper bound   if your model says that at a 95 per cent VaR, the value at risk is half of your assets, you can expect to lose half or more of your assets one day in 20. It should be used to make sure you can withstand these losses, not necessarily to prevent them.  [1] VaR is a mathematical model that purports to estimate the maximum future losses expected from a trading portfolio, with a degree of statistical confidence. VaR's calculation can be extremely technical, or it can be as simple as looking at a subjective past period and then projecting future risks from there. A big problem with VaR is that it can very easily produce very low numbers, gravely misrepresenting true exposures. Relying on the past can be treacherous: a quiet past period need not imply future quietness, historical volatility and correlation may betray you. Also, Var models can use the 'normal probability distribution', which very unrealistically assumes no chance of extreme events. VaR played a key negative role in the 2008 credit crisis, by severely underestimating the danger from toxic mortgage products and by allowing banks to enjoy excessive levels of leverage on their trading positions. Given that toxic leverage is what sank the banks, we could argue that VaR, in the end, caused the crisis. Recognising all this, the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision, which had enthusiastically adopted VaR since 1995, has been busy at work disowning the model and tweaking the bank capital formula. Just a few weeks ago, Basel announced that it no longer wants to keep using VaR. [2] See FT Alphaville - The JPMorgan Whale's regulatory motive (June 2012)"
value chain,"Value chain refers to all the activities, from receipt of raw materials to post-sales support, that together create and increase the value of a product. Value chain analysis is an important tool for evaluating a company's competitive advantage. The term is used in phrases such as ""moving up the value chain"" which means using business processes and resources to produce highly profitable products also known as higher-margin products.   value chain in the news In November 2013 a report focused on the rise of central Europe from a mainly agricultural region to one which was challenging Asia as a destination for outsourcing. However, as the reputation of the region grew, companies were beginning to have to move up the value chain to justify the rising wages. An example was Samsung, the South Korean electronics company, which had opened a research centre in Poland with 13 employees and was now employing more than a 1,000, many of which were highly skilled engineers. Other large centres were moving from classic back office operations, such as call centres and accounting centres, to mid-office functions such as financial analysis and tax management. In May 2013, an FT columnist commented on the different fees being paid to investment managers by UK local authorities for their pensions management. The problem, he wrote, and the reason why anomalies developed was the length of the value chain. The final return to investors was stated but it was unclear how much had been reduced by avoidable fees. "
value fund,Another name for INCOME FUND. [1] 
value investing,"A style of investing developed in the early 1930s at Columbia University by Benjamin Graham (financial strategist), who showed an approach to find and buy stocks at a discount to their intrinsic value, namely to buy stock on sale, or to buy stocks for 50 cents that are worth $1. Example To find truly undervalued stocks, value investors follow a three step process. In the first step, they sort stocks by price/earnings (p/e) or other metrics and concentrate on the lowest p/e stocks. This step enables value investors to reduce the number of stocks they will examine more closely and at the same time identify potentially undervalued stocks by focusing on the lowest p/e stocks.When commentators say value beats growth, they mean the lowest p/e group of stocks returns, on average, more than the highest p/e group.  It is because of this, many investors believe the only thing value investors do is sort stocks by p/e and invest in the lowest p/e stocks.  However, this is just the first step in the value investing process. Next, value investors individually value each of the low p/e stocks to find which of the stocks are truly undervalued.  A stock may have a low p/e because it is a bad stock. The only way to differentiate the good from the bad is to value all stocks in the low p/e group.The final step in the value investing process compares the intrinsic value of each stock to the market price.  If the stock price is lower than the intrinsic value by more than the so-called  margin of safety  (normally around 33% of the intrinsic value) the stock is considered truly undervalued and it is worth investing in. [1]"
value investor,"Someone who invests in stocks, shares etc that are considered to be selling at less than their real worth. [1] "
value proposition,"The benefits that a product or service provides to customers, especially by being different to or better than a competitor's products or services. [1] Customers face a choice when browsing a set of products and/ or services at various prices. The value proposition is the additional benefits the customer receives from a product/ service not offered by other competitors. The value proposition is a combination of the product and/or service and the price charged. Example For instance low-cost airlines, such as Ryan air and EasyJet, have a simple value proposition - point-to-point travel at cheaper prices when compared to traditional carriers flying on similar routes. To be able to offer a reduced price, these budget airlines remove some traditional frills, for example, they only sell snacks and meals on board, instead of offering meals to all passengers as part of the ticket price.  This would also mean less time to clean up between flights leading to an increase in turnaround time.  These airlines tend to use secondary airports which are likely to be less busy and could also create a faster turnaround time. [2]"
value share,
value stock,"A stock that seems cheap in relation to the profits, earnings etc of the company. [1] "
value trap,"A financial instrument (stocks or bonds) that appears cheap on historical measures or valuation grounds, such as price/earnings ratio, but the price never recovers to fair value.  As Warren Buffet said,  price is what you pay, value is what you get"". Such ""bargain"" investments attract buyers because they hope that the price will go up in future so they will make money.  However, the problem is that the stock price can fall again and may never go up unless there is a catalyst. Let us assume you believe that the stocks from company A are cheap because they trade at 10x 2011 earnings when compared to other comparable companies that trade at 12 x 2011 earnings.  The market does not buy company A s stocks  because it does not trust that the earnings estimate for 2011 will be reached. You believe it will be reached and that is why you buy.  When company A delivers their first half results, and if they are on track to meet estimates, then you will be right.  The rest of the market will begin to assess that company A may reach their targets, and the stock will go up, hence, the first half results served as a catalyst. ExampleSome accounting scandals are value traps.  The idea is to trap or lure enough investors to make the company look good financially. Some investors bought Parmalat s bonds in the summer of 2003 on the basis that they were cheap for a company with a strong cash position and balance sheet. [1] The Italian dairy group collapsed in that year with  14bn ($18.5bn) of debts and entered into bankruptcy protection with investors losing money on this investment. In 2010, the court found Mr Calisto Tanzi, former chief executive of the company, guilty of fraudulent bankruptcy and criminal conspiracy. The collapse of Parmalat, dubbed  Europe s Enron , rocked the Italian and European corporate worlds when in late 2003 it admitted an account it claimed to have held at Bank of America with  4bn was a fake. It turned out that the company had been misleading investors about its true value and its share price. Italian pensioners were among more than 100,000 shareholders who lost their life savings in the collapse. [2] ViewEx-head of Parmalat jailed for 18 years"
value-added,"Value-added products or services have an increased value because work has been done on them, they have been combined with other products etc. This increase in value to the buyer is what the buyer pays for. [1] "
value-added reseller,"A company that sells the products or services of another company, especially computers, adding something to them or combining them with other products etc in order to make them worth more. [1] "
value-based pricing,"The term is used when prices are based on the value of a product as perceived from the customer's perspective. The perceived value determines the customer's willingness to pay and thus the maximum price a company can charge for its product. An essential component of value-based pricing is the necessity to determine the value for the customer. In order to define the value a customer associates with a product, the customer value model can be applied. This concept evaluates the economic benefits a product can offer to the customer. ExampleIf business consultants determine their rates as a percentage of costs saved for their clients due to their work, they apply value-based pricing. In this case they calculate their rates depending on the benefits they generate for their clients. [1]"
valued insurance,Another name for AGREED-VALUE INSURANCE. [1] 
values-based leadership,"Motivating employees by connecting organisational goals to employees  personal values. Values-based leaders communicate organisational values that tell members how to behave in order to fulfil the organisation s mission. They talk about these values in a way that connects with employees  personal values, so that employees come to identify strongly with both the organisation and its mission. Such leaders focus on core values - the enduring guiding principles that capture the organisation s strengths and character. Because the core values represent the soul of the organisation, they are likely to remain steadfast in the face of changing market trends and fads. In order for employees to believe in the sincerity and depth of the organisation s values, the leadership team must lead by example and communicate the values on an ongoing basis to the entire workforce. The values  effectiveness lies in how well they are embodied by the organisation as a whole. Example The Boeing Company has carefully defined its core values by establishing high standards in areas such as corporate citizenship, diversity management, and customer satisfaction. Boeing, which describes its employees as its competitive advantage, also strongly emphasises its commitment to fostering a participatory workplace characterised by co-operation and idea sharing. Boeing has also demonstrated its commitment to the broader community by making pledges to protect the environment and supporting causes including education, for example. [1]"

vehicle,A particular type of investment. [1] 
vehicle excise duty,"A form of tax is payable in the UK for various vehicles using the public highway. This vehicle excise duty (VED) was formerly known as the road fund licence, when the monies raised were intended to be directly used to maintain the road system in the early part of the 20th century. It has often colloquially been known as the road fund licence since then, particularly in light of the fact that, prior to October 2014, motor vehicles subject to the tax were required to display a vehicle licence (tax disc) as evidence of having paid the tax. [1]   vehicle excise duty In the UK Summer Budget 2015 speech, the chancellor reinstated a dedicated road tax in the UK for the first time since the 1930s, overhauling levies on new cars and pledging to use the money to improve Britain s highway network. More than two-thirds of new cars sold in the UK have such low carbon-emission ratings that they pay no vehicle excise duty for the first year, putting pressure on revenues raised by the Treasury from motoring taxes. To address the falling receipts, George Osborne said that the government would introduce from April 2017 a new banding system pegged to emissions. First-year rates will vary depending on the level of carbon dioxide emitted per kilometre. Zero-emission, pure electric vehicles will be entirely exempt from excise duty. But all other new cars   including plug-in hybrids, which have electric capability as well as an internal combustion engine and are seen as green alternatives   will be subject to a standard rate of  140 after the first year. [2]"
vehicle sales,"The number of cars, sport utility vehicles and light trucks that are sold over a given period.  As motor vehicles are high-priced consumer durables, monthly sales figures in particular are seen as an indicator of broader economic health in a given country. ExampleVehicle sales figures are typically reported by manufacturers on the first day of the month in the US. In many European, Latin American, and Asian countries the data are more often compiled by national industry associations and released on the first of the month or a few days later. As some months are shorter than others or have different numbers of holidays, month-on-month comparisons can be misleading unless the data are adjusted to take into account actual selling days.   The term is often used interchangeably with ""light vehicle sales.""  [1]"
vehicle scrappage scheme,"This is a scheme co-funded with the car industry that had the objective of increasing the demand for cars in the UK.  Broadly, it enabled consumers to scrap vehicles older than ten years provided that they had owned the car for at least 12 months to replace them with new vehicles at a discount of  2,000.  The scheme was introduced in May 2009 and ended in March 2010. [1]"

venture capital,"Private equity or institutional funding for start-up companies considered to have strong growth prospects. There can be several phases of investment (see seed money), through to the stage when the company is able to go public. Venture capital firms may also provide management assistance and other services. [1] This is equity or quasi equity funding provided by professional investors to young, high growth oriented companies, typically to finance their early market development and growth. As well as funding, investors usually provide value added services. Funding is often provided in stages, providing sufficient cash to reach the next milestone. ExampleLastminute.com, the UK travel and leisure website was founded in 1998 and raised  600,000 from four venture capital firms during the start-up phase. In 1999, an additional  13.5m was raised in two capital increases through the issuance of shares to existing shareholders and key employees, and also to venture capital firms, corporate and institutional investors including Intel Corporation. In 2000, a private placement of preference shares to strategic partners raised  18.5m. In a fourth financing round with some of the existing shareholders, an additional  6.2m was raised. At the IPO in 2000, lastminute.com raised approximately  61m.  [2]"
venture capitalist,Someone who invests money in new businesses. [1] 
venture debt,"Venture debt is a form of debt financing for emerging venture-backed companies.  This type of financing has emerged as a means of financing startups that are ""in between"" more traditional venture capital financing rounds. Traditional venture capital investments occur in stages: staged equity financing allows for the venture capitalist to ensure that the startup has achieved important milestones before releasing additional investment to the company. Typically, the value of the company will increase dramatically upon successfully completing a milestone, because the completion of the milestone signals that the company is less risky than before the milestone was completed. For example, a company developing a radical drug therapy would be less risky after receiving regulatory approval than before receiving regulatory approval. It would therefore be natural to use regulatory approval as a funding milestone. More generally, many startups involved in drug development might have funding milestones that are tied to completing various stages of the clinical trial process. Sometimes companies run short of capital in between funding milestones. Companies who run short of capital are sometimes good candidates for venture debt. As the company has not yet achieved the milestone that will increase its value, taking on new equity capital will dilute the earlier equity investors more than if the new equity investors put their money into the company after the company reached its milestone. [1] ExampleIn 2006, venture loans accounted for 7 per cent of all money invested in US venture capital-backed companies. High profile US companies that have taken on venture debt include MySpace, Cooking.com and Athena Health.

vertical expansion,When a company starts to take on the business activities that are carried out by its suppliers or customers. [1] 
vertical integration,"The merger with or acquisition of a company that performs a different role in the same industry - for instance, when the producer of a good buys the distributor of the same product. This contrasts with horizontal integration, which involves combining with a company that has the same role in the same industry. [1] Vertical integration does not necessarily require a merger or acquisition. It is often the result of internal development. The choice between outsourcing and vertical integration is a crucial decision for most companies. A company should use vertical integration when there is a threat of being unfairly exploited by its supplier. When there is a small number of suppliers, there is a possibility that these suppliers may take advantage of their clients  dependence to behave opportunistically.  By using vertical integration instead of outsourcing, a firm can totally avoid this threat.  Outsourcing has disadvantages that include losing control over the outsourced activity or even exposing clients to the potential opportunism of suppliers.  For instance, they may charge excess fees for services that are not included in the contract. They may also make promises knowing well that they will break these in an instant, should the benefits from breaking these promises exceed the costs or disadvantages. On the other hand, outsourcing is more flexible than vertical integration because suppliers make investments. It is preferable to let suppliers make investments when the environment is uncertain because if the investments go wrong or the assets become obsolete, then the supplier will bear the cost and not the client.  This makes outsourcing less risky than vertical integration. A company should use vertical integration for activities with high strategic value.  These are activities based on resources and capabilities that generate a competitive advantage. For instance, product design is an activity that has high strategic value for Apple. If organisations do not possess the resources and capabilities that can provide them with a competitive advantage, there is a risk that they will become  hollow  corporations. These are companies that have outsourced most of the resources and capabilities necessary to enjoy a competitive advantage and they generally fail. Only activities with limited strategic value can (and should) be outsourced. ExampleThe Disney-Pixar relationship between 1991 and 2006 illustrates the move from outsourcing to vertical integration. Disney outsourced the production of 3D animated films to Pixar in 1991 because there was a lot of uncertainty around the potential of 3D animation. At the time it was not clear whether 3D animated films would be successful or at least as successful as 2D animated films. In addition, 2D animation capabilities were far more likely than 3D animation capabilities to generate a competitive advantage. By 2006, vertical integration had become necessary for Disney because Pixar was taking advantage of Disney s dependence to constantly renegotiate the contract. For instance, after the success of Toy Story (1995), Steve Jobs, who was chief executive of Pixar at the time, threatened to end the relationship with Disney unless the contract terms were adjusted in Pixar s favour. Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive of Disney, eventually agreed to renegotiate the contract in favour of Pixar in exchange for an extended duration. Moreover, the uncertainty surrounding 3D animation had disappeared and this film technique had become essential to the competitive advantage of the animation film industry.

viral marketing,"Viral marketing is an original advertising message created by a company that spreads beyond      the initial recipient to other consumers. The term gets its name from viruses as advertisers hope that their marketing message will spread as easily as the common cold. Example  There are a number of different ways an advertiser can create a viral marketing message:    The message could be designed to be automatically spread by the consumers when they use the product. For instance, email provider Hotmail spread the message about its service by putting a short line at the end of every e-mail indicating that users could sign up for free e-mail accounts at hotmail.com. Thus, every time a user sent an e-mail they also sent a marketing message.   The advertiser can provide a bonus to the original recipient for sending the message on to others. These are sometimes known as refer-a-friend programmes. For instance, Living Social, a deal-of-the-day e-commerce website, gives users a discount if they send an advertisement to three of their friends who then purchase a product.   The message could be designed to be so inspiring, funny or interesting that users want to send it to their friends.  An example of this was subservientchicken.com, which was a website put together by fast food chain Burger King to advertise its chicken sandwiches.  Users who interacted with the website and had so much fun, they would send the link to their friends. [1]   "

vlogger,"This is short for  video blogger ; a person who regularly posts films on the internet about some aspect of their lives   typically comedy, beauty, fashion, music, cooking, adolescent trials and tribulations. If your teenager has locked themselves in their bedroom, chances are they have fallen under the spell of a vlogger. For the generation that has grown up with on-demand internet, traditional television with its strict broadcast schedules is anathema. Rather than viewed from the sofa in the family sitting room, vloggers  shows are consumed on mobile phones, tablets or computers in the privacy of bedrooms, shopping malls and school playgrounds. Vloggers are celebrities, earning money from merchandise, sponsorship and product lines, such as make-up and clothing. For fame-hungry teens vlogging is the latest route to stardom, just like X Factor before it. In part the appeal is bypassing the media gatekeepers. Vloggers were not invented in 2014. As a profession, their short history can be traced to 2007 when Google   which acquired YouTube, the video-sharing site in 2006   launched its partnership programme, enabling vloggers to monetise their content.   Vlogger in the news In 2014, the beauty and fashion vlogger, Zoe Sugg aka Zoella, made publishing history when her first book, Girl Online, registered the highest first-week sales for a debut author since records began. Penguin, her publisher, had offered Zoella a two-book deal worth  50,000. For risk-averse publishers and music companies that have seen the internet eat their profits, vloggers are a godsend: a pre-prepared package with a proven audience. And then it turned out she had help from a ghostwriter, just like Hollywood actors and rock musicians. In a time of disruption, here was reassuring proof that some things really never change. [1]"

wash trading,"Wash trading occurs when a trader buys and sells the same securities simultaneously. Wash trades benefit brokers who earn commissions from the trades. Wash trades can also be used to create the false impression that there is investor interest in the security. Wash trades conducted around the endpoint of a tax year are also sometimes used to evade taxes. Wash trades are not in and of themselves illegal but they are almost always used for illegal purposes.[1]   wash trading in the news In December 2012 more details emerged of UBS's intermal culture at the time that it was manipulating interbank lending rates. Regulators alleged that internal audits at UBS had failed to spot that traders were engaging in wash trades   buying and selling the same securities simply to earn commissions for the brokers who were helping them to manipulate interest rates. According to the UK Financial Services Authority, four traders worked through interdealer brokers to try to influence Japanese yen Libor submissions at other banks. The FSA alleges the UBS traders asked the brokers to pass on requests for specific rates to traders at other banks. they also asked the brokers to place false bids and offers and to manipulate the rates shown on their screens to skew market perceptions of the rates and indirectly influence other banks's submissions to the Libor rate-setting process. The brokers were paid for their help in the manipulation through wash trades. At one point the bank was paying  15,000 a quarter to the brokers for a period of 18 months, the FSA said."

waterbed effect,"A  waterbed effect  occurs in two-sided markets when prices are pushed down, say through regulation, on only one side of the market, resulting in a re-balancing of prices on the other side - much like a waterbed would react if you were to push down one side of it. Understanding and quantifying this  waterbed  phenomenon has important consequences for designing and implementing effective regulatory interventions for any two-sided market. Example Newspapers charge high prices to advertisers and subsidise the price of the paper to readers. Forcing newspapers to charge advertisers only the actual costs incurred to print the copy would inevitably force up the price of newspapers to readers, and possibly reduce the number of papers sold. Regulations of this type are rare among newspapers, but are quite common in other industries. In particular, it is found in telecommunications, where fixed-to-mobile termination rates   the charges mobile operators levy on fixed network operators for call termination   are perceived to be high both in absolute terms and in relation to similar prices charged by fixed network operators. If the market for mobile calling was  one-sided , then forcing the termination price down would be likely to result in a reduction in retail charges. But the greater the extent to which cross-net calling subsidises on-net calling, the greater the likelihood that reducing termination charges will result in increased charges for on-net calls. The point to take from this is that regulation may have unintended consequences in that for some customers prices could rise, not fall, as planned   because of the waterbed effect. [1][/ref]"

wealth management,"Wealth management is a practice that in its broadest sense describes the combining of personal investment management, financial advisory, and planning disciplines directly for the benefit of high-net-worth clients. But it also is an increasingly popular self-branding reference that advisors and financial representatives of many different stripes adopt, often to describe a wide range of possible functions and business models. In the narrowest context, a wealth manager helps a client construct an entire investment portfolio and advises on how to prepare for present and future financial needs. The investment portion of wealth management normally entails both asset allocation of a whole portfolio as well as the selection of individual investments. The planning function of wealth management often incorporates tax planning around the investment portfolio as well as estate planning.  More expansive definitions of the term append other tasks to the wealth management relationship, such as philanthropic counselling or coordination of the governance and routine administrative matters of large families. Other wealth managers add banking and lending capabilities or legal advice to their service mix. Various kinds of financial professionals can claim the title of wealth manager, including advisors, brokers, private bankers and family office representatives. There is no single accepted certification for a wealth manager, though common ones for such professionals include the CFP, CFA, and MBA in the United States. ExampleIn the US, a variety of firms tout themselves as wealth managers. For instance, one of the largest brokerages, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, uses the term to describe its model. Others that freely use the term include independent financial advisors, such as Lexington Wealth Management; trust companies, such as Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management, and private banks such as BNY Mellon Wealth Management.

wearout,Used to describe a situation in which customers are no longer interested in a product or an advertising campaign. [1] 
weather,"If a company, business etc weathers a difficult situation, it manages to come through it safely. [1] "
weather derivative,"Weather derivatives are financial instruments that can be used for risk management purposes to hedge against losses due to adverse, unpredictable weather. In contrast to other derivative products, the underlying asset - such as frost, rain, temperature and wind - has no direct value with respect to the price of the weather derivative. The party that sells a weather derivative bears this risk for a premium and stands to earn a profit if the weather remains relatively stable, predictable or normal. If the weather does turn bad, then the party that purchases the derivative claims the agreed upon amount. As one would expect, temperature is the most commonly used underlying weather factor, 18 degrees Celsius (65 degrees Fahrenheit) is a standard baseline from which deviations are measured, but any other measurable weather-related event can be used as an underlying factor for a weather derivative. As the underlying asset of the weather derivative is non-tradeable these instruments cannot be priced in the same way as more traditional derivatives. There is no standard model for valuing weather derivatives similar to the widely used Black-Scholes formula that is used to price many equity options and similar derivatives. As such they are more prone to modelling risk than other types of derivative products. Example The main users of weather derivatives are energy companies as demand for their products can vary drastically due to extreme weather conditions. The agricultural industry is the second main user of such instruments although other purchasers include firms arranging major sporting (outdoor) events and even tour operators. Hedge funds are reputedly also major investors in this alternative asset class. A broad range of weather derivative products are available including options, futures, forwards and swaps. Most are traded over-the-counter (OTC) although there are some traded electronically on indexes like the Chicago Merchantile Exchange (CME). The CME offers weather derivative products that  offers trading opportunities related to temperatures, snowfall, frost and hurricanes. The products are based on a range of weather conditions in more than 47 cities in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and Asia, with the hurricane products geared to nine US regions.

welfare-to-work," This is a scheme launched by the UK government, in June 2011, to help 2.5m unemployed people, who are claiming benefits, to get jobs over the next five years. According to government figures, more than 1m people have been on benefits for more than a decade. Approved providers such as private companies and voluntary organisations secure contracts to find work for claimants. Source: Nicholas Timmins, Public Policy Editor and George Parker, Political Editor, Financial Times Providers will be paid largely by results. There is a relatively small advanced payment for taking people on, but that will be phased out over three years. The providers will then be paid in stages. The first money will come once they have got someone into work for 13 or 26 weeks, depending on the client group. Further payments will be made every four weeks for keeping them there   for up to two years in the case of former incapacity-benefit claimants who are furthest from the jobs market. In practice, this means a maximum payment of  2,200 for getting an 18 to 24-year-old into a sustained job, and as much as  14,000 for getting the hardest to help into work and keeping them there. From the taxpayers  point of view, this looks like a remarkably good deal: payment more or less entirely by results. The providers have to fund most of the programme themselves. They take the risk until they get results. The results are mainly paid for out of benefit savings. And for the providers there is the potential for this to be a market worth  2bn to  3bn a year   if all goes well.

The Nottingham-based recruitment agency has paid  3m for Fourstar, which has a five-year contract with the Department for Work and Pensions from July 2011. It is the ninth acquistion in 18 months for Staffline, which supplies 17,000 blue-collar workers a day to clients including Tesco, J. Sainsbury, Premier Foods and Nestl .

white space,"Unused parts of the airwaves previously reserved for television broadcasts are referred to as white space. White space technology allows mobile broadband to be carried over unused, and unlicensed, broadcast frequencies, which could be used by smartphones and tablets as well as a range of business applications. In effect, the technology fills in the gaps between the frequencies that are otherwise used to broadcast TV. Just as the words on a page are separated by white space, which prevents the sentences from overlapping, the white spaces in radio frequencies prevent clashes and interference from disrupting TV broadcasts. This is intended to fill the need for scarce spectrum, as mobile users become increasingly hungry for data on the move. Spectrum is the finite natural resource that that enables wireless technology to work. The amount of spectrum available for mobile use is limited, and owned by only a few major companies in many global markets. This means there is an escalating problem in trying to satisfy the demands of consumers who have come to expect fast downloading of applications and video without overloading the network. The technology uses signals that can travel large distances and through walls. This can lead to the creation of a faster and powerful wireless service which can benefit those living in rural areas or without access to broadband. Google co-founder Larry Page described this development as  WiFi on steroids .   white space in the news The UK is likely to be among the first to adopt wider white-space coverage. Ofcom, the communications watchdog in the UK, is leading the European agenda on white space, having unveiled plans in September 2013 to provide the regulatory backbone of a functioning network. The regulator will create a central database to help devices find the right space in which to operate without causing interference. The organisation has identified white space technology as an important means of meeting critical capacity shortages for mobile communications in future. More people are using bandwidth-hungry data services such as social media, video and gaming on the back of the rapid growth in smartphones and tablets. Ofcom warns that this could overload existing services   its experts predict an 80-fold increase in mobile data use by 2030   and has mapped out a strategy for the next decade to free up and share unused parts of a finite spectrum of available bandwidth. Google and Microsoft are also backing national trials of mobile services across fallow parts of the broadcast spectrum that could help avert a looming shortage of mobile frequencies. The two US technology groups, as well as British Telecom and other smaller British groups, will test out different consumer uses before a commercial rollout expected to take place in 2014. This includes the rollout by Microsoft of a free public WiFi service using white space in Glasgow, in Scotland, a city with the lowest rates of broadband uptake in the UK. [1]"
white space investment,"Inventors can make great entrepreneurs, but this is not necessarily the case. For every James Dyson, turning a bagless vacuum cleaner into a multinational business, there is a Johannes Gutenberg, the pioneering 15th-century printer who changed the world of communication forever but died in poverty. This does not stop angel investors and venture capitalist firms trawling the planet for original ideas. The venture capitalists of Silicon Valley have a phrase for this type of investment:  white space . Backing completely new ideas may be risky, but the rewards are significantly greater, the VCs argue. Well, that is the theory.   white space investment in the news Experience shows that the best investments are often made in copycats. Facebook did not invent social networking, Apple did not invent the smartphone, the PC or the tablet computer, and search engines were around a long time before Google. The trick these businesses pulled off was to do better something that was already available. White space investments may be exciting, but it is better to back a business whose space is filled with paying customers. Imitation is not just the sincerest form of flattery, it is often the best way to create a business that will make money. [1]"
white squire,"A white squire defence is where a friendly company or investor purchases a large enough share of the target company to stop an unwelcome bidder from achieving its aim of taking over the target company. Once that unwelcome bidder has withdrawn its bid, the white squire will then typically sell its shares. A white squire defence helps a company fend off a hostile takeover, but has no intention of taking over the company itself. The term white squire arose in the 1980s as an alternative to white knight. The white knight is a company or individual that helps defend a company from an unwelcome bidder by buying the target itself. The problem for a target company in an M&A; bid which enlists the assistance of a 'white knight' is that the target gives up its independence, albeit to a preferred bidder (the white knight) instead of the initial bidder which the target did not like. So, in order to stop an unwelcome bidder whilst at the same time remaining independent, the concept of a white squire defence was developed.   white squire defence in the news A famous example of this defence was in 2005 when the attempt of Shareholders United to stop Malcolm Glazer's bid to take over Manchester United FC fully. They would have been able to achieve this if they had purchased approximately 8 per cent of the outstanding shares, but were unsuccessful in this. Another more recent example of a white squire defence can be found in the report: Carlos Slim s Am rica M vil threatens to drop  7.2bn KPN bid In 2013, Carlos Slim s Am rica M vil group threatened to drop its  7.2bn takeover bid for KPN after being blocked by an independent foundation. In this instance, the foundation entrusted with protecting the target company had blocking rights related to the Dutch telecoms company, KPN. In both these cases, it was not the intention, or not expected, that the owner of the shares obtained in the white squire defence would be used to take over the respective companies.[1]"

Windfall profits can be revealed thanks to a rapid rise of prices in a sector, where assets and capacity of production are fixed and already financed. A new regulation or tariff system can also lead to this phenomenon. These profits are unexpected and by nature not directly foreseen by the concerned actors. Windfall profits could be seen as a business opportunity. Regulators and government traditionally think about setting up specific taxes (called windfall profit taxes) to capture a part of this value creation. Example In the electricity industry, the rapid rise of European prices on the competitive market in 2004 and 2005 lead hydroelectric and nuclear power producers to a very attractive position. The debate also occurred a few years ago with the impact of free CO2 allocation in the electricity prices. It has been criticized for having generated windfall profits to power suppliers.

This is an effort to improve the structure of their stock portfolios just before they report to clients in their annual reports or before the end of a reporting period.ExampleA key aspect of managing other people s money is to keep your clients invested with you. Clients are typically happier if you show that you hold a basket of stocks that have performed well and that other people have invested in. Towards the end of the year and as the end of reporting period approaches, institutional investors sell underperforming and obscure stocks and move their money into more popular or well-known stocks. In the process, they depress these stocks  prices towards the end of the year. At the same time, this action can also increase the popularity of broadly-based, glamorous and outperforming stocks as portfolio managers gravitate towards strong performers to include in their reports to clients.

wirehouse,"Originally named  wirehouses  because of an advanced communications system they employed, today the term simply refers to large financial institutions that offer multiple services in various locations, such as a bank. The term typically refers to full-service brokerages that offer research, order execution and investment advice all under the same roof. [1] A wirehouse is a large integrated broker with a national, as opposed to regional, business.  Wirehouses once collected trade orders from branch offices in distant cities using dedicated telegraph lines, hence the term wirehouse. Telegraphs were replaced by phones, which in turn were replaced by dedicated proprietary computer lines.  Now most traders routinely route their orders directly to their brokers over the internet.  The brokers at most wirehouses provide financial research and financial advice to their clients.  Many wirehouses also have investment banking divisions. More generally, the term wirehouse refers to any large financial institution that uses electronic systems to transmit information among its branches. Commercial banks and insurance companies that maintain multiple branch offices thus may be considered wirehouses, but the term now is rarely applied to financial institutions that do not have large brokerage operations.

Active WOM campaigns usually involve giving free samples to influential customers, or hiring professional  agents  to promote a brand, product or service. Passive WOM marketing activities usually consist of observing conversations that are naturally taking place, primarily on the internet. These observations may be qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative analysis of online social interactions relies on studying discussion boards, blogs, forums, review sites, newsgroups, social networks, etc. Quantitative analysis of online WOM consists in collecting various metrics on specific keywords, based on search volume, number of blog posts, number of tweets, etc. Such signals may be used to track, analyze and forecast the diffusion of a new product.ExamplesPassive WOM marketing services include Nielsen BuzzMetrics, Cymfony, Clarabridge, Collective Intellect, Nielsen Online, Google Trends / Google Insights for Search, BlogPulse, Networked Insights, Technorati and Twittorati.Active WOM marketing services include Electric Artists, DMC, Ivy Worldwide (previously Buzz Corps), Barbarian group, BzzAgent, Vocalpoint, SheSpeaks, Wildfire and Promojam.

work-life balance,"A situation in which you are able to give the right amount of time and effort to your work and to your personal life outside work, for example to your family or to other interests. [1]"
work-life conflict/ enrichment,"Individuals are engaged in multiple roles: for instance you may be a manager, a parent, a fund raiser for a charity and many other roles. You are likely to experience a work-life conflict when you cannot fully achieve your goals because of time constraints.  For example,  an important meeting can conflict with you attending a football game with your children; you experience diverging role expectations such as your personal values conflicting with your work values;  Work-life conflict is physical - as you will not be able to attend both the meeting and the football game - and psychological - you may not pay attention in the meeting because you are concerned about your children s reaction. However, you may experience work-life enrichment when you benefit from being engaged in multiple roles, because you may transfer skills and knowledge from one domain to another. For instance, you can use your fund raising skills to contribute to a project at work, or your professional planning skills to organise a family vacation. Your professional network can help your children find an internship, while your neighbour may prove a useful work contact. The skills and knowledge involved with bringing up children may be enhanced by your experience as a manager.  Also, your family may provide emotional support when you encounter problems at work. Most individuals experience both work-life conflict and work-life enrichment simultaneously. The extent to which one feels conflict and/or enrichment depends on the following five factors:  the quality of the roles the person is engaged in For instance, the satisfaction with one s job or the quality of one s relationships with partner and children.  If the person is highly satisfied with his/ her roles, s/he is more likely to cope with the demands of their responsibilities. the demands of the roles This involves job and household workload, or the emotional demands at work and at home.  The more demanding the role, the more challenging it may be for the person to deal with the pressure. the control one has over the roles For instance, schedule flexibility, or affordable back up child care. If a person has control and flexibility over their work schedule to fit in other commitments such as child care, then it may ease the pressure on him/ her. one s personalityFor instance, being efficient and confident are qualities to help manage work-life conflict.  the individual s ability to cope with the various roles This refers to the strategies individuals use to manage the demands of their roles, such as the ability to separate work and non-work, being assertive and taking up exercise such as yoga to reduce stress levels.  Example Some life stages are typically more prone to work-life conflict. The term  sandwiched  generation refers to individuals in the 30-50 age bracket who face both child and elderly care responsibilities (looking after ageing parents) while being employed. These individuals encounter work-life conflict more if they are also working to progress up the hierarchy as opposed to just holding a job. Work-life enrichment may be experienced in managerial, senior and junior professional roles, provided there is a sense of mutual benefit between work and life. For instance, your professional planning skills may help you plan your family holiday. [1]"
work-life culture,"Work-life culture can be defined as the set of beliefs and values shared within an organisation regarding maintaining a healthy and sustainable work-life balance. A supportive work-life culture is one where employees take up flexible working, such as teleworking or working flexible hours.  They do not suffer career penalties compared to employees who work regular or standard hours. Time expectations are an important component of work-life culture and take into account considerations such as:  Are employees expected to work long hours  How often should they take breaks  Is it acceptable that they may be off work for certain periods of time   Supervisor support is also important and considerations include:  Do supervisors value their employees being engaged in multiple roles and let them have flexible work options  Do they assess their employees  performance on results instead of time spent in the office  Are they sensitive to their employees work-life need and refer them to work-life programmes when necessary   ExampleAt Best Buy s headquarters, two HR professionals started the famous ROWE culture with stands for results only work environment. Work is measured in output, not hours. Performance reviews are based on results, not face time. When employees have a doctor s appointment or a parent-teacher meeting, they go ahead and make up for that time so that the work gets done. There are no mandatory meetings.  Gap outlets have also implemented ROWE. They have no meetings on Friday afternoons and provide employees with laptops so they could work from home. [1]"
work-life programme,"Work-life programmes are HR programmes provided by employers to help reduce work-life conflict and foster work-life enrichment. They typically include flexible working options as well as financial support, information (such as employee assistance programmes) and infrastructures (such as on-site childcare or gym) pertaining to four areas of life outside of work: health and well-being, child and elderly care, daily life (covering activities such as booking a holiday or finding a special gift) and personal projects (such as going back to school and taking up voluntary work). The most advanced practices emphasise supervisor training to raise supervisors  awareness of available policies and help them implement the policies. They also make an attempt to change the way the organisation works and the mindset of the workers, by encouraging them to assess performance based on results rather than time spent in the office for instance - see work-life culture. Well run work-life programmes help organisations attract and retain employees, reduce absenteeism, stress and burnout, plus enhance employee engagement and job satisfaction. ExamplesAt ATP Denmark, a pension and investment company, their employee benefits include providing home workstations, flexible working hours, take-home organic meals three times a week, a dry cleaning service, a gym that employees may use during working hours and a playroom for children if employees need to take their children to work for the day. Daimler offers all employees a community service day where they can take eight hours per year to devote themselves to a cause that is important to them (source: Great place to Work Institute). [1]"

year on year YOY,"When measuring the difference between performance, prices, quantities or indeed any other value of something, it is common to measure the most recent value against the value measured exactly a year earlier. Year on year (yoy) is often used to avoid confusion with a change in value in the calendar year to date (ytd), or indeed the financial year to date (ytd). For example a company who reports, in June perhaps, that its share price has risen 5 per cent year on year, might have seen its share price jump by 10 per cent in the year to date, if most of the price movement had been in more recent months.   Year on year or YOY in the news At the end of 2012 analysts were observing that Chinese refined copper net imports had risen 73 per cent year on year (yoy).

yield,"Generally, the income generated by an asset on an annual basis, expressed as a percentage of the asset's purchase or market price. For stock investments, the yield is the total dividend for the latest year as a proportion  of the share price. For bonds, the yield is the same as the coupon rate (if the bond is purchased at par or is trading at par). Any increase or decrease of the yield relative to the coupon rate is roughly proportionate (though in the inverse direction) to any change in the bond price (yields fall as prices rise, and vice-versa). [1] Equity dividend yields may be calculated both net and gross. Most people and organisations use the net method.  The calculation for the yield is net dividend pence per share multiplied by 100 then divided by the share price. [2]"
yield advantage,The additional yield earned by holding a company's convertible securities rather than its common shares.
yield curve,"A graphical representation of the relationship between the yields and maturities of different bonds of similar quality, currency denomination and risk (usually government bonds). Normally a yield curve slopes upwards (a positive or normal yield curve), as one would expect longer-dated bonds to have a higher yield than shorter-term ones (because an investor should expect to earn more for taking on longer-term risk). If that situation is reversed, for instance because of an unusually high supply of short-term paper, the curve slopes downward (an inverted or negative yield curve). A yield curve can also be flat (with little difference between short-term and long-term interest rates), depending on supply and demand or inflationary expectations.

zero interest rate policy zirp,"A zero interest rate policy or zirp is a route taken by a central bank to keep the base rate at zero per cent in an attempt to stimulate demand in the economy by making the supply of money cheaper. The term is also used to describe a near zero benchmark rate set by countries such as the UK in the post financial crisis years, which kept interest rates near to zero and accompanied that policy with measures such as quantitative easing.   zirp in the news In July 2012 the FT's markets blog, Alphaville, returned to a theme in which it argued against zirp policies. It argued such a rate policy could have a disastrous impact on collateral markets and money market funds, not to mention the net interest income of lending institutions. All of which could unleash a protracted deflationary spiral."

zero-hours contract,"A zero hours contract is an employment contract used in the UK where workers are not guaranteed work but are expected to remain available. The amount of work can vary resulting in little or no pay. Employers can call in workers, those with contracts, when they need them, but do not need to pay them for hours that they remain available but have not been working. Employees on zero hours contracts typically receive few or no employee benefits such as holiday pay or sick pay and are not entitled to redundancy pay. For workers who might otherwise be unemployed, the advantage is that they can keep using their skills and they might end up fully employed.   zero hours contracts in the news In April 2013 it was reported that professionals in UK including doctors, lecturers and journalists were being put on zero hours contracts. The report referred to a British Labour Force survey which found that the total number of employees on zero hours contracts rose 25 per cent over 2012 and had risen more than 150 per cent since the autumn of 2005."

zero-sum game,An economic transaction in which whatever is gained by one party must be lost by the other.
zombie bank,"A bank/ company that is insolvent but continues to operate until its fate is resolved by closure or merger. [1] ExampleBeginning in 1990, Japan suffered a collapse in real estate and stock market prices that pushed major banks into insolvency. Rather than follow America's tough recommendation - and close or recapitalise these banks - Japan kept banks marginally functional through explicit or implicit guarantees and piecemeal government bail-outs. The resulting ""zombie banks"" - neither alive nor dead - could not support economic growth. A period of weak economic performance called Japan's ""lost decade"" resulted. [2] Scores of companies were cast into an  undead  state   in the sense of being too weak to flourish, but too complex and costly for their lenders to shut down.  Hence they remained half-alive, poisoning the corporate world by silently spreading a sense of stagnation and fear.  [3] During the lost decade, this was when property values fell by as much as 80 per cent and economic growth slid to the bottom of the G7 league as the country moved in and out of recession. Prices in general began to fall, heightening the debt burden of companies. Deflation stalked the land, with zombie companies kept alive by equally insolvent banks. [4] Japan s experience in the past two decades, in particular, make clear that a banking system populated by zombie banks is a major threat to recovery; banking systems remain dysfunctional until losses are fully recognised and disclosed; and procrastination increases the ultimate cost to the taxpayer.

zombie company,"A company that is kept alive by lenient creditors and low interest rates even though it is too weak to invest or expand.   zombie companies in the news In January 2013 UK entertainment retailer, HMV, called in administrators putting the jobs of its 4,000 employees at risk. The crisis at HMV came hot on the heels of trouble for other British high street retailers   Comet, Jessops, JJB, Clinton and Game   which had resulted in 15,000 redundancies in the preceding months. But some economists took the view that too few companies were going bust in Britain and these weak, ""zombie companies"" were holding back the UK's economic recovery. Bank of England data made available towards the end of 2012 appeared to support those economists' theory   about 30 per cent of British companies were lossmaking in 2010, a bigger proportion than in the 1990s recession, but corporate insolvency rates were lower."
zombie fund,"This is a closed with-profits fund that no longer writes new business or policies. This can include pension and investment funds. [1] With-profits funds were for many years the mainstay of the financial services industry, being widely sold as a way of building up pension funds or to pay off a mortgage. But the amounts they repay investors is based on formulas so complicated that they puzzle financial advisers, let alone their clients. ExampleThere are two types of with-profits policies: a with-profits bond, which invests a lump sum payment; or an endowment, where you pay in a fixed amount every month. Both are long-term schemes and there are two components to the money you get back: a regular bonus, which is typically paid once a year, and a final, or maturity, bonus when your policy comes to an end. When you sign up, the contract will specify the length of the scheme, and may guarantee a level of bonus payments. Annual bonus rates are normally lower than interest rates on the more generous current accounts, let alone savings accounts. So whether your with-profits policy ends up being a good deal will depend on the size of your final bonus.""

zombie household,"Zombie households refer to homeowners who are in debt and who have seen the value of their homes and savings fall. Yet, they are saved from bankruptcy and reposession because the interest rates on their mortagages are so low. [1] However, if interest rates move back up to normal levels, it is possible that these individuals will not be able to service their debt. [2] ExampleBritain may face a long and difficult road to recovery because of an earlier housing and credit boom has led to a generation of  zombie households  among low-income groups who cannot save enough to ever repay their debts and begin spending again, according to a study conducted by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research in 2012. According to data from the Financial Services Authority (FSA), over 40 per cent of mortgages generated in the years before the boom are interest-only and those borrowers are no further towards repaying their debts than they were five years ago. The FSA also estimates that between 5 to 8 per cent of all mortgages are only avoiding foreclosure because banks are showing  forbearance. The Office for Budget Responsibility and the Bank of England have remained broadly unconcerned about the level of household debt because it overwhelmingly was used to purchase housing, giving households a financial asset that offsets the debt.
